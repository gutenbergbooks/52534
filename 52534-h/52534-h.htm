<h2>THOMAS HUGHES.</h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—Having somewhat rashly consented
to write a short biographical preface to a volume of
selections to be made in America from the writings of my
friend, Mr. Hughes, I applied to him directly for the needful
facts and dates. His answer was an autobiographical letter
which I found so interesting that I resolved to print it, omitting
only a few intimate allusions natural in such a communication,
but with which the public has nothing to do. My
temptation was the greater that the letter was not intended
for publication, and had, therefore, that charm of unpremeditated
confidence which is so apt to be wanting in more deliberate
autobiographies. I cannot consult him, (and I confess
that I purposely waited till I could not) for he is already at
sea, on his way to America, and I fear that friendship may
have tempted me to an unwarrantable liberty, but I could not
bring myself, even at the risk of seeming indiscreet, to deny
to others what had given me so much pleasure. At any rate,
the indiscretion is wholly my own and in direct violation of
the injunction with which Mr. Hughes’ letter concludes: “I
hate the idea of being presented in any guise to any public;
so if you can’t squelch the plan altogether, give only the driest
and meagrest facts and dates.” I feel somewhat as if I
had been reporting a private conversation, and take upon
myself in advance all the reproach that belongs of right to
that scourge and desecrator of modern life, the “Interviewer.”
For the first time, I look forward with dread to my next meeting
with an old friend, after having thus practised the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
stage device of putting the right letter into the wrong
cover. As the brief record of a well-spent and honorable
life, devoted to unselfish ends and associated with notable
friendships, Mr. Hughes’ letter has a higher than merely personal
interest. Of any critical introduction to American
readers no one could stand in less need than he. The same
qualities of manliness, frankness, simplicity and sympathy,
with whatever is generous and humane, that gave and continue
to “Tom Brown” a success that may be compared with
that of “Robinson Crusoe,” are not wanting in his other
works.—<span class="smcap">J. R. L.</span>]</p></div>


<p>“I was born on October 20th, 1822, at Uffington, Berks,
of which village my grandfather was Vicar. He was also a
Canon of St. Paul’s, and spent half the year at his house in
Amen Corner, with which my first memories of London are
connected. It was, till this year, the strangest quiet old nook
in the city, behind its big timber gates, within one hundred
yards of Fleet street on one side, and Newgate Market on
the other, but the distant murmur of life only made the repose
more striking in those days. Now they are building
some new minor Canons’ houses on the vacant ground beyond
which will be opened out towards Newgate street, and the
corner will be a thoroughfare. The most remarkable fact of
my childhood happened there, as I was in the house (I believe)
with Sir Walter Scott, a great friend of my grandfather,
on his last sad visit to London.</p>

<p>“My grandmother was a very notable woman in many
ways, and a great economist and early riser. She used to
take me and my brother out shopping in the early morning,
and our excursions extended as far as Billingsgate fish-market,
then at the height of the career which has secured for it
an unenviable place in our English vocabulary. It was
certainly a strange place for a lady and small boys, and is
connected with the most vivid of my childish memories.
Toddling after my grandmother to the stall where she made
her purchases, we came one morning on the end of a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
between a stalwart fish-fag and her fancy man. She struck
him on the head with a pewter pot which flattened with the
blow. He fell like a log, the first blood I had ever seen, gushing
from his temples, and the scene is as fresh as ever in my
memory at the end of half a century. The narrow courts in
that neighborhood are still my favorite haunts in London.</p>

<p>“But my town visits were short. I was a thorough country-bred
boy, and passed eleven months in the year at the foot
of the Berkshire chalk-hills, much in the manner depicted in
‘Tom Brown.’</p>

<p>“I was sent to school at the early age of eight, to accompany
my elder brother. It was a preparatory school for
Winchester, and the best feature about it was the Winchester
custom, called ‘standing up,’ which means that we were encouraged
to learn a great deal of poetry by heart, for which
we got extra marks at the end of the half year. We were
allowed (within limits) to choose our own poets, and I always
chose Scott from family tradition, and in this way learned the
whole of the ‘Lady of the Lake,’ and most of the ‘Lay of
the last Minstrel’ and ‘Marmion,’ by heart, and can repeat
much of them to this day. Milton reckoned highest for
marks, but I was prejudiced against him in this wise:
Not far from the school was Addington, a place of the then
Duke of Buckingham, who was also a friend of my grandfather,
who, with my grandmother, paid him a visit at the end
of our first half year. We went over to sleep, and travel
back home next day with the old folk, and in the morning
before starting, the Duchess gave us each a sovereign, neatly
wrapped up in white, glossy paper. It was the first piece of
gold I ever had, and I kept it in my hand to look at on the
journey. I was leaning out of the window of the carriage
when my attention was suddenly called to some roadside
sight, and I dropped the precious metal. My shout of anguish
and dismay brought the carriage to a stand-still, and I had to
confess. After some trouble my sovereign was found, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
taken charge of by my grandmother, who, in due course,
returned it to me, no longer in current coin of the realm, but
in the shape of a pocket edition of Milton’s poems, with
‘Thomas Hughes from the Duchess of Buckingham and
Chandos’ written on the title page. I still possess the
odious small volume, and have learnt to forgive the great
Puritan,—indeed, I have read Masson’s life of him with real
interest in these latter days. But I never learnt a line of
him by heart as a boy, and regret it to this day.</p>

<p>“Those were evil days in Wessex, the time of the Swing
riots and machine and rick burning. My father was the
most active magistrate in the district, and was constantly in
the saddle, keeping the King’s peace. He was an old fashioned
Tory, but with true popular sympathies, and had played
cricket and football all his life with the men and boys of our
village, and it is one of my proudest memories that only one
man from Uffington joined the rioters, and he came back
after three weeks ashamed and penitent. Amongst other
good deeds, my father rode off alone one night and saved the
house and chapel of a dissenting minister in a neighboring
village from being sacked and burned. Nevertheless I can
not pretend to say that I was brought up to look upon dissenters
as anything but a stiff-necked and perverse generation.</p>

<p>“At the age of ten, February 1834, I was sent on to Rugby
with my brother, as, happily for us, Arnold had been a college
friend of my father. Here I stayed till I was nearly nineteen,
starting from the bottom and ending in the sixth form,
though by no means at the head of the school.</p>

<p>“It was a very rough, not to say brutal, place when I went
there, but much mended during those years.</p>

<p>“I was a very idle boy so far as the regular lessons were
concerned, and I expect I should have been advised to go
elsewhere early in my career but for a certain fondness for
history and literature which Arnold discovered in me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
which (I fancy) covered a multitude of sins. He first struck
it at a monthly examination of the Shell, then the form intervening
between the fourth and fifth. He asked the head boy
why it was the Romans had so specially rejoiced over the
terms of a certain treaty with the Parthians (we were reading
Horace, I think). It came all down to the lowest bench
where I was, and I said, ‘because they got back the eagles
taken from Crassus,’ and sent a gleam of pleasure into the
Doctor’s face which was getting rather grim. Up I went
to the top of the form, and from that time he often asked me
questions <i>outside</i> the text book and specially by way of illustration
from Scott’s novels, to which he was fond of referring.
I could generally come to the point, having them at my fingers’
ends, and was proud of my consequent recognition. To this
day I remember the feeling of grief and humiliation which
came across me when I failed him on a critical occasion. It
was years after the above event when I was in the sixth,
and some distinguished visitor (Bunsen, I think it was) was
present at the lesson. We were reading the passage in
Aristotle about old age, (is it in the Ethics or Politics? I’m
sure I forget) and he asked the head of the school to illustrate
from Scott’s novels what Aristotle says about the characteristic
of old age, to be absorbed in petty interests and to
be careless about great contemporary events. Down came
the question, past some very able and some very studious
boys, since distinguished one way or another—past John
Connington, Matt. Arnold, Sir R. Cross, to me—and then the
Doctor paused for several seconds with a confident look.
But no response came and he passed on, ‘and I was left
lamenting.’ No one answered, and he had to remind us of
the old Abbot, pottering away in his garden on the border,
when Mary and her defeated followers ride up before Crossing,
and the old monk leans on his spade and looks after
them, saying, ‘I could pity this poor Queen and these Lords,
but what are these things to a man of four score—and it’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
fine growing morning for the young kale-wort’—and so goes
to his spading again.</p>

<p>“I cannot help to this day wondering at the patience and
forbearance both of him and my tutor, Cotton, afterwards
Bishop of Calcutta, over my frightful copies of verses, and
Greek and Latin prose. As I was head of the eleven at
cricket, and of bigside at football, I naturally had but small
leisure to devote to such matters, and consequently my copies
were notorious for the number of <i>picture frames</i> they were
certain to contain,—picture frames being the strong black
marks which the Doctor used to make round bad, false
concords <img src="images/i-008a.jpg" width="167" height="57" alt="munus hospitalis" />
or quantities <img src="images/i-008b.jpg" width="137" height="53" alt="munera stare" /></p>

<p>“He used to do it slowly and grimly, his under lip seeming
to grow out as the pen went deliberately round the
wretched words, and one did not feel good during the operation.
But as no boy enjoyed the sausage seller’s buffooneries,
or Socrates’ banters more than I, (tho’ I made sad hashes in
construing them) I remained in favor, tho’ incorrigible, till
the end.</p>

<p>“I carried away from Rugby dreadfully bad scholarship,
but two invaluable possessions. First, a strong religious
faith in and loyalty to Christ; and secondly, open mindedness.
It was said (and is still said, I believe,) of Arnold, by way of
censure, that to him everything was an open question every
morning of his life. And though he never made any direct
effort to unsettle any of our convictions that I can remember,
we went out into the world the least hampered intellectually
of any school of English boys of that time. To this day I
am always ready to change an old opinion the moment I can
get a better one, and so I think it has been with many of my
old school-fellows, though we believed ourselves to be a
thorough <i>true blue</i> school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I also owe to Rugby my strong democratic bias,
but I don’t think it. I guess I was born so (or <i>barn-zo</i>, as
Wessex chaw-bacon pronounced it in the famous story). As
a little scrap in petticoats nothing pleased me so much as
playing with the village children, and I could never understand
why they shouldn’t have all the things I had. At any rate
it was at Rugby that I first was able to indulge my radical
propensities. Up to my time, the school-close (or playgrounds)
was kept as sacred ground, no ‘lout’ (as we
politely called the neighboring lieges) being allowed to set
foot within the precincts, and I had often noticed the insolent
airs with which casual intruders in fustian or corduroy had
been extruded. So when I became head of the eleven (and
so a sort of constitutional monarch in the close) I asked the
best cricketers amongst the ‘louts’ to come in and practice
with me on summer evenings, and got up matches with their
club, to the great advantage, I still believe, of school as well as
town.</p>

<p>“I was dreadfully loath to leave, and when I was obliged,
(as nineteen is the limit of ages) was much averse to going
up to Oxford. I knew that my scholarship was too weak to
allow me to take anything like high honors, and so, as my
profession was to be the Bar, I wanted to go up to London at
once and enter at an Inn of Court. My father, however, after
consulting his legal friends, decided that I should go to Oxford,
and accordingly I went up to his old College, Oriel,
in February, 1842. My first year at Oxford was utterly
wasted, except that I learned to pull a good oar, and perfected
myself in boxing, which was then much in vogue, several
prize-fighters being generally kept in pay by the under-graduates.
The lectures were perfectly easy to me as I had
read all the books at Rugby, and I employed no private tutor.
I knew I couldn’t take high honors, (or at any rate choose to
think so) and as I happened to fall into an idle, fast set, just
did as the rest, and made a fool of myself in all the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
ways. But I never much enjoyed that kind of thing and got
very sick of it by the time I had taken my little-go, and
towards the end of my second year, just before I was of age,
the most important event of my life happened, for in the long
vacation I became engaged to my wife, then a schoolgirl, the
great friend of my only sister. This pulled me up short. Our
parents very properly said we were silly young people and
must not see one another for years, or correspond, that we
might see whether we really knew our minds. I went back
to Oxford quite a new man, knocked off all not absolutely
necessary expense, and lived decently and soberly for the rest
of my time, taking my degree the first moment I could without
coaching, by which I saved money. Consequently, with the
help of a small legacy of £200, which came to me at twenty-one
from an old great-aunt, I came away quite out of debt
and with some small balance towards furnishing chambers in
London, which was fairly creditable, as, there being three of
us up at once, my father only allowed us £200 a year each.
This was supposed to be too small for a fellow to live on!!
Alas, it is even worse now, I fear!</p>

<p>“I had the good luck to be under Clough (the poet) and
Fraser, now Bishop of Manchester, who were Oriel tutors at
that time, and the latter of whom is still one of my closest
friends. I went up, as I have said, believing myself still a
Tory, but left Oxford a Radical. Something of the change
was owing to the insolence of undergraduate life at that day,
but more to a tour I took with a pupil through the North in
the long vacation of my third year. My pupil was the son of
a neighboring Berkshire squire, and all his father wanted was
that I should keep him out of mischief. If he could be interested
or taught anything, so much the better. We happened
to stop at a Commercial hotel in Lancashire on our
way North, and in the bagman’s room I got into an argument
with some of the North county travellers on the subject of
the Corn Laws, then prominently before Parliament. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
first night I came speedily to the conclusion that I knew very
little about the matter, and before I returned to Oxford for
Michaelmas term I had become a good free-trader.</p>

<p>“I was nearly twenty-two when I went up to London,
straight from Oxford, to begin my legal career. My father
kindly suggested that I should take a run on the Continent
before settling down, to get up my French and German to
the point at any rate of tolerably fluent small talk, and here
again I have no doubt but he was right, as the want of early
training of ear and tongue has left me a helpless mortal ever
since. However, I was determined to lose not a month or a
week if I could help it, and soon found myself in small rooms
on the third floor at No. 15 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, from the
windows of which, on a fine day, I could see the Surrey hills.
I paid £30 a year for the chambers, and lived in them for
another £70, keeping down my whole expenditure within
£100 a year, a feat I am still rather proud of. I never could
have done it but for a glorious old woman who kept the
house, and did for all the inhabitants, of whom only two lived
in their chambers. She had come up from Devonshire as a
girl some fifty years before to that house where she had been
ever since, and in all that time had never seen the Thames,
which is, as you know, not five minutes’ walk from Lincoln’s
Inn Fields; nor St. Paul’s, except the dome, from the top
windows of No. 15. She still spoke with a delightful Devonshire
accent, all her U’s being as soft as if she had left Torquay
yesterday, and I won her heart at once by professing,
or I should say acknowledging, a passion for <i>junket</i>, which she
prepared in a reverent and enthusiastic manner on the slightest
excuse. As my wife that was to be lived in Devonshire,
the coincidence was peculiarly grateful to me, and the dear
old woman, Roxworthy by name, could not have had my
interests more at heart had I been her own son.</p>

<p>“There I lived for two years and upwards pleasantly
enough, for several old school and college friends had chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
in the neighborhood. My engagement was a constant
stimulus to work and economy, and made me indifferent as
to society. I just visited two or three family friends on
Sundays, and for the rest did very well without it. From my
own experience I would have every youngster get engaged by
the time he is twenty-one, though I am not prepared to maintain
that a long engagement is so good for girls as for boys.
Mine at any rate was the making of me. My democratic
instincts grew in strength during these years, notwithstanding
the failure of my first practical endeavors to act up to them.
One of these I will mention. Every house in the Square was
entitled to a key of the five gardens, in which I spent most of
the long summer evenings; and, seeing the number of ragged
children who came round the railings and looked wistfully
through at the lawns and beds within, I extended my privilege
to them and used to let them in by the scores, and
watch them tumbling on the grass and gathering the daisies
with entire satisfaction. From the first, this outrageous proceeding
greatly scandalized the Beadle, whose remonstrances
I entirely disregarded, until at last a notice came from the
Trustees of the Square that the key of No. <b>15</b> would be called
in. This threat so alarmed poor Mrs. Roxworthy that I was
fain to promise amendment, and so ceased myself to frequent
the gardens. At the end of thirty years a strong effort is
being made, as you may see in the papers, to throw the gardens
open; so I live in hopes before long of seeing my revenge
on the ghost of the Beadle of my day.</p>

<p>“I read hard at the law, but it was very much against the
grain, and my endeavors to master the subtleties of contingent
remainders, executory devises, the <i>scintilla juris</i>, and
all the rest of it, were only partially successful. I sometimes
think I might have taken <i>con amore</i> to common law and to
criminal business, but conveyancing and real property law
had no attractions for me, beyond the determination, if I could,
to make a living by them. I read with a very able conveyancer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
and kindly old gentleman, who did his best to
impart the mysteries to some six pupils. He soon found
where my strength, such as it was, lay, and employed me in
the preparation of deeds—such as appointments of new
Trustees, where the operative part was quite simple common
form, but long statements of fact had to be made in the recitals.
These I rather excelled at, and on the whole, by the
time I was of standing to be called to the Bar, was probably
about as fit for that ceremony as the average of my cotemporaries.</p>

<p>“Three months before it took place I was married, the
probation which my wife’s parents had very properly insisted
on, having expired at the beginning of 1847, and we being
found entirely in the same mind after our three years of
separation. Most of our friends thought us mad, as we
started on the vast income of £400 a year. It was confidently
foretold that we should be living on our friends or in
the workhouse before long, which prophesies however were
entirely falsified. We started in tiny lodgings, almost opposite
the house we now live in, and always managed to pay
our way in the worst of times. And though I admit the experiment
was a risky one, I have never repented it.</p>

<p>“The year of my call, 1848, was the year of revolutions,
and on the 10th of April I paraded, like the rest of respectable
society, as a special constable, though with shrewd misgivings
in my own mind that the Chartists had a great deal to
say for themselves. In which belief I soon found sympathizers.
Frederick Maurice had recently been appointed Chaplain
of Lincoln’s Inn, and was gathering round him a number
of young Barristers and Students, whom he was putting to
work in their spare time at a ragged school, and visiting the
poor in a miserable district near Lincoln’s Inn. Contact with
our wretched clients soon made it clear to us that something
more radical and systematic was needed to raise them to
anything like independence. They were almost all in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
hands of slop sellers, chamber masters, or other grinders of
the faces of the poor. What could be done to deliver them?
In the autumn, one of our number spent some time in Paris
and came back full of the material and moral effects of association
amongst the workmen there.</p>

<p>“We resolved to try the experiment and accordingly formed
ourselves into a society for promoting Workingmen’s Associations,
with Maurice as president. The idea grew on us
apace, and soon called out an amount of enthusiasm which
surprised ourselves. We were all busy men, tied to offices
from ten till five, so we met at six in the morning and eight
at night to settle our rules, and organize our work. We were
all poor men too, but soon scraped together enough money
to start our first Association. This we resolved should be a
tailoring establishment, for which we could ourselves, with the
help of our friends, find sufficient custom in the first instance.
We had no difficulty in hiring good airy workshops, but how
to fill them was the rub. We were now in communication
with a number of poor workpeople, especially amongst the
Chartists, and, to cut a long story short, started our Association
with a slop-worker who had been in prison as manager,
and some dozen associates of kindred opinions in the workroom.</p>

<p>“I needn’t trouble you with any details of the Christian
Socialist movement, of which this was a beginning, and which
made a great noise in the press and elsewhere at the time.
It has survived any number of follies and failures, and has
gradually spread till there is a union of Societies all over the
kingdom, doing a work for our poorer classes which one
can only wonder at and be thankful for.</p>

<p>“We wrote tracts, and started a small paper, ‘The Christian
Socialist,’ and were soon at open strife with nearly the
whole of our press, both the ‘Edinburgh’ and the ‘Quarterly’
condescending to bestow on us contemptuous, but very angry
articles, in which they were joined by weeklies and dailies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
innumerable. But we were young, saucy, and so thoroughly
convinced we were right that ‘we cared, shall I say, not a
d—n for their damning.’</p>

<p>“Most of my friends looked very serious, and prophesied
that my prospects at the Bar would be ruined by my crotchets,
and indeed I was dreadfully afraid of this myself. But the
state of things in England was so serious, and I was so thoroughly
convinced of the necessity of work in this direction,
that I couldn’t give it up. No doubt I lost some business by
it, but other business came, as I was wonderfully punctual at
Chambers and soon got to be friends with my few clients,
who even got to pardon, with a shrug of the shoulders, the
queer folk they often found there. And queer no doubt they
were for a Chancery barrister’s chambers, as emissaries from
the tailors’, shoemakers’, printers’, and builders’ Associations
(we had a dozen of them going by this time) were often in
and out about their rules and accounts and squabbles. I
only remember one instance in which I really suffered. A
dear old gentleman, a family friend of ours, had managed
with much difficulty to persuade his solicitor to give me some
business. That most respectable of men, head of a firm
which could have made any young barrister’s fortune, arrived
one afternoon at my chambers with a brief, and was asked
by my clerk to sit down for a moment till I was disengaged.
This he did, graciously enough, though no doubt with the
thought ‘how little I could know my business to keep him
waiting even for a moment,’ when my door opened, and a
full-blown black person (lately from the West Indies in quest
of advice and aid for the freedmen there) walked out. This
was too much for my intending client, who hurried away,
saying he would call again, but I never saw his brief or
him.</p>

<p>“So things went on for some years during which I managed
to maintain my growing family without dropping my
work for the Associations. We had migrated to Wimbledon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
for health’s sake, where we built a house side by side with one
of the other Promoters, which had one large room common
to both houses, the subject of much chaff and fun to our
visitors and acquaintance. Our garden was also in common,
and both arrangements, I think, answered well.</p>

<p>“About this time Maurice became convinced that if Associations
of working people were to succeed, the men must be
better educated in the highest sense. So he set to work to
establish the Workingmen’s College, of which he was the first
and I am the present Principal. It is a very noteworthy institution,
at which, by the way, Emerson and Goldwin Smith, besides
Stanley, Kingsley, Huxley, and other eminent Englishmen,
have delivered opening addresses, at the beginning of
the academical year, in October.</p>

<p>“I found it at first very hard to discover my mission at the
college. I tried lectures on the law of combination and
association, but they did not draw, and all the other classes
for which I was competent, were filled by much better
teachers from amongst our number. So, noting how badly
set up the men were with round shoulders, and slouching
gait, and how much they needed some strong exercise to
supple them, I started a boxing class, and had some horizontal
and parallel bars put up in the back-yard. These proved
a great success, and at last it became clear to me, that all my
Oxford time spent on such matters had not been thrown
away. In connection with the boxing and gymnastic classes,
we started social gatherings for talk and songs, over a cup of
tea, which also were wonderfully successful. I remember
Hawthorne coming to one of them; brought by his friend, H.
Bright, of Liverpool, and quite losing his shyness and reserve
for the evening.</p>

<p>“By this time we had a boy of eight, and, thinking over
what I should like to say to him before he went to school, I took
to writing a story as the easiest way of bringing out what I
wanted. It was done mainly in the long vacation of 1856,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
but wasn’t published till early in the next year, and made
such a hit that the publishers soon betrayed the secret, and I
became famous!</p>

<p>“Whereupon arose again the professional bugbear, now set
at rest for years. I had managed to get over and live down
Christian Socialism, but who on earth would bring business
to a successful author! I considered whether I shouldn’t
throw over Lincoln’s Inn and take to writing, but decided
that the law was best for me, and determined to stop writing.
This good resolution held for two years, when the Berkshire
festival of scouring the White Horse, (an old Danish or
Saxon, certainly Pagan figure, still left on our chalk-hills,)
came round, and my old country friends made such a point of
having an account of it from me that I gave in and wrote my
book No. 2.</p>

<p>“By this time my clients had become case-hardened, and finding
no particular ill effects from my previous escapades, I gave
in in a weak moment to a tempting offer of Macmillan’s, and
wrote ‘Tom Brown at Oxford,’ for his magazine. Moreover,
I had now made a plunge into public life, and was one
of the leaders of a semi-political party. This is how it came
about: There had been roused in me lively sympathies with
the Abolitionists, and I had followed eagerly the progress of
events through the Fugitive Slave, and Free Soil agitations.
There was no warmer sympathizer with Garrison and John
Brown and Levi Coffin, in England; so when the Lincoln
election came, and South Carolina led off the seceding states
with jubilant applause of society in England, I went at once
fiercely into the other camp. You may judge of the difficulty
of getting our public men of note to take active sides with the
North (tho’ many of them didn’t conceal their sympathy,
and were ready to speak in Parliament, and write,) by the
fact that I was about the most prominent speaker at the first
great public meeting, which was held in London. This proved
to be such an extraordinary success, that there was no further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
effort on the part of the jingoes (that name hadn’t yet been
invented, but it was precisely the same party,) to demonstrate
publicly in the metropolis. In other centres there was need
of such work, and I went to Birmingham and Liverpool to
speak and deliver lectures on the war and its causes and
issues. It was supposed that there was to be a row at the
latter place, which was the stronghold of the Rebels; but all
went off quietly.</p>

<p>“It was mainly in consequence of these doings that I was
asked by the working folk in South London to stand for Lambeth
in 1865. I did so, and was brought in triumphantly at
the head of the Poll, and almost all the expense paid by subscription.
From that time I gradually gave up legal business,
and in 1868 took silk, as it is called, <i>i. e.</i>, became a Queen’s
Counsel. In 1869 I wrote ‘Alfred the Great’ for Macmillan’s
Sunday Series. I now made it my chief business to attend to
Social-Political questions in Parliament; sat on two Trades
Unions Commissions; got amendments to the Industrial and
Friendly Societies Acts through the House, but never took
to party politics.</p>

<p>“In 1870, as I hope you remember, I paid my delightful
visit to America.</p>

<p>“In 1872 I lost my dear eldest brother, and soon after
wrote the memoir of him for my family. Maurice also
died, and I became Principal of the Workingmen’s College.</p>

<p>“Before the next election (1874) the Co-operative question
had come to the front. The success of the Upper Class
London Supply Societies [copies of our working-class Associations
in their main principle and features] had roused the
tradesmen throughout the country. I was a candidate for
Marylebone, and was fiercely opposed by the tradesmen, and
supported by the professional and working classes. There
were three Liberal candidates for only two seats, so it was
agreed to refer it to the Attorney General to say who should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
retire, and he decided that I had the worst chance of winning
the seat (on one-sided and insufficient evidence, as my supporters
maintained, and I think rightly). I therefore retired,
and got no chance of entering that Parliament. For by this
time the Trades Protection Society had been organized, to
fight against neither small nor great, but only against those
accursed revolutionists who had supported the Co-operative
movement, and refused to flinch from it.</p>

<p>“So it happened that I was again thrown out at the election
this year. I had consented, on the unanimous and unsolicited
request of the Liberal party in Salisbury, to stand
there, and all went well till just before the election, when the
Trades Protective people permitted the party organization to
throw me over. I doubt if I shall ever return to the House,
as my views on the Church question make me an almost
hopeless candidate in the North of England, and my support
of Co-operation a perfectly hopeless one at present in the
South. I care, however, very little about it, having plenty to
do outside in keeping irons hot, especially that most interesting
of all my irons, the Tennessee settlement, which I hope
to keep very hot indeed, and look upon as about the most
hopeful of the many New Jerusalems which have attracted me
during my pilgrimage. I am off to open Chapter II. of that
Romance [Chapter I., the getting the titles clear, buying
the land, &amp;c., having taken some two years.] on the
12th of next month, and I can’t tell you how much my heart
is in it.</p>

<p>“And so end my confessions. The only other points of
interest, omitted above, are the publication of the ‘Old
Church,’ in 1877, when the disestablishment movement
began to get serious, and ‘The Manliness of Christ,’ this
Spring, (1880), which latter has been already republished on
your side in four different forms; and lastly, my share
in the Volunteer movement, which I joined at its start in
1859. The Workingmen’s College raised a corps of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
companies at once, of which, after serving for a few weeks as
private, I was made Captain. It soon swelled into a regiment,
the 19th Middlesex, of which I became Colonel, and
served in it twelve years.”</p>

<h2>TRUE MANLINESS.</h2>




<h2>I.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE conscience of every man recognizes courage
as the foundation of true manliness, and manliness
as the perfection of human character, and if
Christianity runs counter to conscience in this matter,
or indeed in any other, Christianity will go to the wall.</p>

<p>But does it? On the contrary, is not perfection of
character—“Be ye perfect as your Father in heaven is
perfect,” perfection to be reached by moral effort in the
faithful following of our Lord’s life on earth—the
final aim which the Christian religion sets before individual
men, and constant contact and conflict with evil
of all kinds the necessary condition of that moral effort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and the means adopted by our Master in the world in
which we live, and for which he died? In that strife,
then, the first requisite is courage or manfulness, gained
through conflict with evil—for without such conflict
there can be no perfection of character, the end for
which Christ says we were sent into this world.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>II.</h2>


<p>“Manliness and manfulness” are synonymous, but
they embrace more than we ordinarily mean by the
word “courage;” for instance, tenderness and thoughtfulness
for others. They include that courage which
lies at the root of all manliness, but is, in fact, only its
lowest or rudest form. Indeed, we must admit that it
is not exclusively a human quality at all, but one which
we share with other animals, and which some of them—for
instance the bulldog and weasel—exhibit with a
certainty and a thoroughness, which is very rare amongst
mankind.</p>

<p>In what, then, does courage, in this ordinary sense
of the word, consist? First, in persistency, or the
determination to have one’s own way, coupled with contempt
for safety and ease, and readiness to risk pain or
death in getting one’s own way. This is, let us readily
admit, a valuable, even a noble quality, but an animal
quality rather than a human or manly one. Proficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in athletic games is not necessarily a test even of animal
courage, but only of muscular power and physical
training. Even in those games which, to some extent,
do afford a test of the persistency, and contempt for
discomfort or pain, which constitute animal courage—such
as rowing, boxing, and wrestling—it is of necessity
a most unsatisfactory one. For instance,
Nelson—as courageous an Englishman as ever lived,
who attacked a Polar bear with a handspike when he
was a boy of fourteen, and told his captain, when he
was scolded for it, that he did not know Mr. Fear—with
his slight frame and weak constitution, could
never have won a boat-race, and in a match would have
been hopelessly astern of any one of the crew of his
own barge; and the highest courage which ever animated
a human body would not enable the owner of it,
if he were himself untrained, to stand for five minutes
against a trained wrestler or boxer.</p>

<p>Athleticism is a good thing if kept in its place, but
it has come to be very much over-praised and over-valued
amongst us.</p>

<p>True manliness is as likely to be found in a weak as
in a strong body. Other things being equal, we may
perhaps admit (though I should hesitate to do so) that
a man with a highly-trained and developed body will be
more courageous than a weak man. But we must take
this caution with us, that a great athlete may be a brute
or a coward, while a truly manly man can be neither.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>




<h2>III.</h2>


<p>Let us take a few well-known instances of courageous
deeds and examine them; because, if we can find
out any common quality in them we shall have lighted
on something which is of the essence of, or inseparable
from, that manliness which includes courage—that
manliness of which we are in search.</p>

<p>I will take two or three at hazard from a book in
which they abound, and which was a great favorite some
years ago, as I hope it is still, I mean Napier’s <i>Peninsular
War</i>. At the end of the storming of Badajos, after
speaking of the officers, Napier goes on: “Who shall
describe the springing valor of that Portuguese grenadier
who was killed the foremost man at Santa Maria?
or the martial fury of that desperate rifleman, who,
in his resolution to win, thrust himself beneath the
chained sword-blades, and then suffered the enemy to
dash his head in pieces with the end of their muskets.”</p>

<p>Again, at the Coa: “A north-of-Ireland man, named
Stewart, but jocularly called ‘the boy,’ because of his
youth, nineteen, and of his gigantic stature and strength,
who had fought bravely and displayed great intelligence
beyond the river, was one of the last men who came
down to the bridge, but he would not pass. Turning
round he regarded the French with a grim look, and
spoke aloud as follows, ‘So this is the end of our brag.
This is our first battle, and we retreat! The boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Stewart will not live to hear that said.’ Then striding
forward in his giant might he fell furiously on the
nearest enemies with the bayonet, refused the quarter
they seemed desirous of granting, and died fighting in
the midst of them.”</p>

<p>“Still more touching, more noble, more heroic, was
the death of Sergeant Robert McQuade. During
McLeod’s rush, this man, also from the north of Ireland,
saw two men level their muskets on rests against a
high gap in a bank, awaiting the uprise of an enemy.
The present Adjutant-general Brown, then a lad of sixteen,
attempted to ascend at the fatal spot. McQuade,
himself only twenty-four years of age, pulled him back,
saying in a calm, decided tone, ‘You are too young,
sir, to be killed,’ and then offering his own person to
the fire, fell dead pierced with both balls.” And, speaking
of the British soldier generally, he says in his preface,
“What they were their successors now are.
Witness the wreck of the <i>Birkenhead</i>, where four hundred
men, at the call of their heroic officers, Captains
Wright and Girardot, calmly and without a murmur
accepted death in a horrible form rather than endanger
the women and children saved in the boats. The records
of the world furnish no parallel to this self-devotion.”</p>

<p>Let us add to these two very recent examples: the
poor colliers who worked day and night at Pont-y-pridd
with their lives in their hands, to rescue their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
buried comrades; and the gambler in St. Louis who
went straight from the gaming-table into the fire, to the
rescue of women and children, and died of the hurts
after his third return from the flames.</p>

<p>Looking, then, at these several cases, we find in each
that resolution in the actors to have their way, contempt
for ease, and readiness to risk pain or death, which we
noted as the special characteristics of animal courage,
which we share with the bulldog and weasel.</p>

<p>So far all of them are alike. Can we get any
further? Not much, if we take the case of the rifleman
who thrust his head under the sword-blades and allowed
his brains to be knocked out sooner than draw it back,
or that of “the boy Stewart.” These are intense assertions
of individual will and force—avowals of the rough
hard-handed man that he has that in him which enables
him to defy pain and danger and death—this and little
or nothing more; and no doubt a very valuable and
admirable thing as it stands.</p>

<p>But we feel, I think, at once, that there is something
more in the act of Sergeant McQuade, and of the
miners in Pont-y-pridd—something higher and more
admirable. And it is not a mere question of degree,
of more or less, in the quality of animal courage. The
rifleman and “the boy Stewart” were each of them
persistent to death, and no man can be more. The
acts were, then, equally courageous, so far as persistency
and scorn of danger and death are concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
We must look elsewhere for the difference, for that
which touches us more deeply in the case of Sergeant
McQuade than in that of “the boy Stewart,” and can
only find it in the motive. At least, it seems to me
that the worth of the last lies mainly in the sublimity of
self-assertion, of the other in the sublimity of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>And this holds good again in the case of the <i>Birkenhead</i>.
Captain Wright gave the word for the men to fall
in on deck by companies, knowing that the sea below them
was full of sharks, and that the ship could not possibly
float till the boats came back; and the men fell in,
knowing this also, and stood at attention without uttering
a word, till she heeled over and went down under
them. And Napier, with all his delight in physical
force and prowess, and his intense appreciation of the
qualities which shine most brightly in the fiery action of
battle, gives the palm to these when he writes, “The
records of the world furnish no parallel to this self-devotion.”
He was no mean judge in such a case; and,
if he is right, as I think he is, do we not get another
side-light on our inquiry, and find that the highest temper
of physical courage is not to be found, or perfected,
in action but in repose. All physical effort relieves
the strain and makes it easier to persist unto death
under the stimulus and excitement of the shock of
battle, or of violent exertion of any kind, than when
the effort has to be made with grounded arms. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
other words, may we not say that in the face of danger
self-restraint is after all the highest form of self-assertion,
and a characteristic of manliness as distinguished
from courage.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>IV.</h2>


<p>The courage which is tested in times of terror, on
the battle-field, in the sinking ship, the poisoned mine,
the blazing house, presents but one small side of a
great subject. Such testing times come to few, and to
these not often in their lives. But on the other hand,
the daily life of every one of us teems with occasions
which will try the temper of our courage as searchingly,
though not as terribly, as battle-field or fire or wreck.
For we are born into a state of war; with falsehood
and disease, and wrong and misery in a thousand
forms lying all around us, and the voice within calling
on us to take our stand as men in the eternal battle
against these.</p>

<p>And in this life-long fight, to be waged by every one
of us single-handed against a host of foes, the last
requisite for a good fight, the last proof and test of our
courage and manfulness, must be loyalty to truth—the
most rare and difficult of all human qualities. For
such loyalty, as it grows in perfection, asks ever more
and more of us, and sets before us a standard of manliness
always rising higher and higher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>And this is the great lesson which we shall learn
from Christ’s life, the more earnestly and faithfully we
study it. “For this end was I born, and for this cause
came I into the world, to bear witness to the truth.” To
bear this witness against avowed and open enemies is
comparatively easy; but, to bear it against those we
love; against those whose judgment and opinions we
respect, in defense or furtherance of that which approves
itself as true to our own inmost conscience, this
is the last and abiding test of courage and of manliness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>V.</h2>


<p>How natural, nay, how inevitable it is, that we should
fall into the habit of appreciating and judging things
mainly by the standards in common use amongst those
we respect and love. But these very standards are apt
to break down with us when we are brought face to face
with some question which takes us ever so little out of
ourselves and our usual moods. At such times we are
driven to admit in our hearts that we, and those we respect
and love, have been looking at and judging things,
not truthfully, and therefore not courageously and manfully,
but conventionally. And then comes one of the
most searching of all trials of courage and manliness,
when a man or woman is called to stand by what approves
itself to their consciences as true, and to protest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for it through evil report and good report, against all
discouragement and opposition from those they love or
respect. The sense of antagonism instead of rest, of
distrust and alienation instead of approval and sympathy,
which such times bring, is a test which tries the
very heart and reins, and it is one which meets us at all
ages, and in all conditions of life. Emerson’s hero is
the man who, “taking both reputation and life in his
hand, will with perfect urbanity dare the gibbet and the
mob, by the resolute truth of his speech and rectitude of
his behavior.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>VI.</h2>


<p>After all, what would life be without fighting, I should
like to know? From the cradle to the grave, fighting,
rightly understood, is the business, the real, highest,
honestest business of every son of man. Every one who
is worth his salt has his enemies, who must be beaten,
be they evil thoughts and habits in himself, or spiritual
wickednesses in high places, or Russians, or border-ruffians.</p>

<p>It is no good for Quakers, or any other body of men
to uplift their voices against fighting. Human nature
is too strong for them, and they don’t follow their own
precepts. Every soul of them is doing his own piece of
fighting, somehow and somewhere. The world might
be a better world without fighting, for anything I know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but it wouldn’t be our world; and therefore I am dead
against crying peace, when there is no peace, and isn’t
meant to be. I am as sorry as any man to see folks
fighting the wrong people and the wrong things, but I’d
a deal sooner see them doing that, than that they should
have no fight in them.</p>

<p>You can’t alter society, or hinder people in general
from being helpless and vulgar—from letting themselves
fall into slavery to the things about them if they
are rich, or from aping the habits and vices of the rich
if they are poor. But you may live simple, manly lives
yourselves, speaking your own thought, paying your own
way, and doing your own work, whatever that may be.
You will remain gentlemen so long as you follow these
rules, if you have to sweep a crossing for your livelihood.
You will not remain gentlemen in anything but the
name, if you depart from them, though you may be set
to govern a kingdom.</p>

<p>In testing manliness as distinguished from courage,
we shall have to reckon sooner or later with the idea
of duty. Nelson’s column stands in the most conspicuous
site in all London, and stands there with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
men’s approval, not because of his daring courage.
Lord Peterborough, in a former generation, Lord Dundonald
in the one which succeeded, were at least as
eminent for reckless and successful daring. But it is
because the idea of devotion to duty is inseparably connected
with Nelson’s name in the minds of Englishmen,
that he has been lifted high above all his compeers in
England’s capital.</p>

<p>In the throes of one of the terrible revolutions of the
worst days of imperial Rome—when probably the
cruelest mob and most licentious soldiery of all time
were raging round the palace of the Cæsars, and the
chances of an hour would decide whether Galba or Otho
should rule the world, the alternative being a violent
death—an officer of the guard, one Julius Atticus,
rushed into Galba’s presence with a bloody sword,
boasting that he had slain his rival, Otho. “My comrade,
by whose order?” was his only greeting from the
old Pagan chief. And the story has come down
through eighteen centuries, in the terse, strong sentences
of the great historian, Tacitus.</p>

<p>Comrade, who ordered thee? whose will art thou
doing? It is the question which has to be asked of
every fighting man, in whatever part of the great battlefield
he comes to the front, and determines the manliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of soldier, statesman, parson, of every strong man,
and suffering woman.</p>

<p>I think that the more thoroughly we sift and search out
this question the more surely we shall come to this as

or wilfulness, lies at the root of all courage, but courage
can only rise into true manliness when the will is surrendered;
and the more absolute the surrender of the
will the more perfect will be the temper of our courage

<p>Haste and distrust are the sure signs of weakness, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
not of cowardice. Just in so far as they prevail in any
life, even in the most heroic, the man fails, and his work
will have to be done over again. In Christ’s life there
is not the slightest trace of such weakness or cowardice.
From all that we are told, and from all that we can
infer, he made no haste, and gave way to no doubt,
waiting for God’s mind, and patiently preparing himself
for whatever his work might be. And so his work from
the first was perfect, and through his whole public life
he never faltered or wavered, never had to withdraw or
modify a word once spoken. And thus he stands, and
will stand to the end of time, the true model of the
courage and manliness of boyhood and youth and early
manhood.</p>

<p>We listened to Dr. Arnold, as all boys in their better
moods will listen (aye, and men too for the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that,) to a man whom we felt to be, with all his heart and
soul and strength, striving against whatever was mean
and unmanly and unrighteous in our little world. It
was not the cold, clear voice of one giving advice and
warning from serene heights to those who were struggling
and sinning below, but the warm, living voice of
one who was fighting for us by our sides, and calling on
us to help him and ourselves and one another. And
so, wearily and little by little, but surely and steadily on
the whole, was brought home to the young boy the
meaning of his life; that it was no fool’s or sluggard’s
paradise into which he had wandered by chance, but a
battle-field ordained from of old, where there are no
spectators, but the youngest must take his side, and the
stakes are life and death. And he who roused this
consciousness in them, showed them at the same time,
by every word he spoke in the pulpit, and by his whole
daily life, how that battle was to be fought; and stood
there before them their fellow-soldier and the captain of
their band. The true sort of a captain, too, for a boys’
army, one who had no misgivings and gave no uncertain
word of command, and, let who would yield or make
truce, would fight the fight out (so every boy felt) to the
last gasp and the last drop of blood. Other sides of his
character might take hold of and influence boys here
and there, but it was this thoroughness and undaunted
courage which more than anything else won his way to
the hearts of the great mass of those on whom he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his mark, and made them believe first in him, and then
in his Master.</p>

<p>To stand by what our conscience witnesses for as truth,
through evil and good report, even against all opposition
of those we love, and of those whose judgment we
look up to and should ordinarily prefer to follow; to
cut ourselves deliberately off from their love and sympathy
and respect, is surely one of the most severe trials
to which we can be put. A man has need to feel at
such times that the Spirit of the Lord is upon him in
some measure, as it was upon Christ when he rose in
the synagogue of Nazareth and, selecting the passage of
Isaiah which speaks most directly of the Messiah,
claimed that title for himself, and told them that to-day
this prophecy was fulfilled in him.</p>

<p>The fierce, hard, Jewish spirit is at once roused to
fury. They would kill him then and there, and so
settle his claims once for all. He passes through them,
and away from the quiet home where he had been
brought up—alone, it would seem, so far as man could
make him so, and homeless for the remainder of his
life. Yet not alone, for his Father is with him; nor
homeless for he has the only home of which man can be
sure, the home of his own heart shared with the Spirit
of God.</p>

<p>We have been told recently, by more than one of
those who profess to have weighed and measured
Christianity and found it wanting, that religion must
rest on reason, based on phenomena of this visible,
tangible world in which we are living.</p>

<p>Be it so. There is no need for a Christian to object.
We can meet this challenge as well as any other. We
need never be careful about choosing our own battlefield.
Looking, then, at that world as we see it, laboring
heavily along in our own time—as we hear of it
through the records of the ages—I must repeat that
there is no phenomenon in it comparable for a moment
to that of Christ’s life and work. The more we canvass
and sift and weigh and balance the materials, the more
clearly and grandly does his figure rise before us, as the
true Head of humanity, the perfect Ideal, not only of
wisdom and tenderness and love, but of courage also,
because He was and is the simple Truth of God—the
expression, at last, in flesh and blood of what He who
created us means each one of our race to be.</p>

<p>“My father,” said Hardy, “is an old commander in
the royal navy. He was a second cousin of Nelson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Hardy, and that, I believe, was what led him into the
navy, for he had no interest whatever of his own. It
was a visit which Nelson’s Hardy, then a young lieutenant,
paid to his relative, my grandfather, which decided
my father, he has told me; but he always had a strong
bent to sea, though he was a boy of very studious
habits.</p>

<p>“However, those were times when brave men who
knew and loved their profession couldn’t be overlooked,
and my dear old father fought his way up step by step—not
very fast, certainly, but still fast enough to keep him
in heart about his chances in life.</p>

<p>“He was made commander towards the end of the
war, and got a ship, in which he sailed with a convoy of
merchantmen from Bristol. It was the last voyage he
ever made in active service; but the Admiralty was so
well satisfied with his conduct in it that they kept his
ship in commission two years after peace was declared.
And well they might be, for in the Spanish main he
fought an action which lasted, on and off, for two days,
with a French sloop-of-war, and a privateer, either of
which ought to have been a match for him. But he had
been with Vincent in the <i>Arrow</i>, and was not likely to
think much of such small odds as that. At any rate, he
beat them off, and not a prize could either of them make
out of his convoy, though I believe his ship was never
fit for anything afterwards, and was broken up as soon
as she was out of commission. We have got her compasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and the old flag which flew at the peak through
the whole voyage, at home now. It was my father’s own
flag, and his fancy to have it always flying. More than
half the men were killed or badly hit—the dear old
father among the rest. A ball took off part of his knee-cap,
and he had to fight the last six hours of the action
sitting in a chair on the quarter-deck; but he says it
made the men fight better than when he was among
them, seeing him sitting there sucking oranges.</p>

<p>“Well, he came home with a stiff leg. The Bristol
merchants gave him the freedom of the city in a gold
box, and a splendidly-mounted sword with an inscription
on the blade, which hangs over the mantel-piece at
home. When I first left home, I asked him to give me
his old service-sword, which used to hang by the other,
and he gave it me at once, though I was only a lad of
seventeen, as he would give me his right eye, dear old
father, which is the only one he has now; the other he
lost from a cutlass-wound in a boarding party. There
it hangs, and those are his epaulettes in the tin case.
They used to be under my pillow before I had a room
of my own, and many a cowardly down-hearted fit have
they helped me to pull through; and many a mean act
have they helped to keep me from doing. There they
are always; and the sight of them brings home the dear
old man to me as nothing else does, hardly even his letters.
I must be a great scoundrel to go very wrong
with such a father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s see—where was I? Oh, yes; I remember.
Well, my father got his box and sword, and some very
handsome letters from several great men. We have
them all in a book at home, and I know them by heart.
The ones he values most are from Collinwood, and his
old captain, Vincent, and from his cousin, Nelson’s
Hardy, who didn’t come off very well himself after the
war. But my poor old father never got another ship.
For some time he went up every year to London, and
was always, he says, very kindly received by the people
in power, and often dined with one and another Lord of
the Admiralty who had been an old mess-mate. But
he was longing for employment, and it used to prey on
him while he was in his prime to feel year after year
slipping away and he still without a ship. But why
should I abuse people and think it hard, when he
doesn’t? ‘You see, Jack,’ he said to me the last time
I spoke to him about it, ‘after all, I was a battered old
hulk, lame and half-blind. So was Nelson, you’ll say;
but every man isn’t a Nelson, my boy. And though I
might think I could con or fight a ship as well as ever,
I can’t say other folk who didn’t know me were wrong
for not agreeing with me. Would you, now, Jack, appoint
a lame and blind man to command your ship, if
you had one?’ But he left off applying for work soon
after he was fifty (I just remember the time), for he
began to doubt then whether he was quite so fit to command
a small vessel as a younger man; and though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had a much better chance after that of getting a ship (for
William IV. came to the throne, who knew all about
him), he never went near the Admiralty again. ‘God
forbid,’ he said, ‘that his Majesty should take me if
there’s a better man to be had.’”</p>

<p>At last in my dream, a mist came over the Hill, and
all the figures got fainter and fainter, and seemed to be
fading away. But as they faded, I could see one great
figure coming out clearer through the mist, which I had
never noticed before. It was like a grand old man,
with white hair and mighty limbs, who looked as old
as the hill itself, but yet as if he were as young now as
he ever had been; and at his feet were a pickaxe and
spade, and at his side a scythe. But great and solemn
as it looked, I felt that the figure was not a man, and I
was angry with it. Why should it come in with its
great pitiful eyes and smile? Why were my brothers
and sisters, the men and women, to fade away before it?</p>

<p>“The labor that a man doeth under the sun, it is all
vanity. Prince and peasant, the wise man and the fool
they all come to me at last and I garner them away,
and their place knows them no more!” So the figure
seemed to say to itself, and I felt melancholy as I
watched it sitting there at rest, playing with the fading
figures.</p>

<p>At last it placed one of the little figures on its knee,
half in mockery, as it seemed to me, and half in sorrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
But then all changed; and the great figure began
to fade, and the small man came out clearer and clearer.
And he took no heed of his great neighbor, but rested
there where he was placed; and his face was quiet, and
full of life as he gazed steadily and earnestly through
the mist. And the other figures came flitting by again
and chanted as they passed, “The work of one true
man is greater than all thy work. Thou hast nought
but a seeming power over it, or over him. Every true
man is greater than thee. Every true man shall conquer
more than thee; for he shall triumph over death,
and hell, and thee, oh, Time!”</p>

<p>The strain and burden of a great message of deliverance
to men has again and again found the weak places
in the faith and courage of the most devoted and
heroic of those to whom it has been entrusted. Moses
pleads under its pressure that another may be sent in
his place, asking despairingly, “Why hast thou sent
me?” Elijah prays for death. Mohammed passes years
of despondency and hesitation under the sneers of
those who scoff, “There goeth the son of Abdallah,
who hath his converse with God!” Such shrinkings
and doubtings enlist our sympathy, make us feel the tie
of a common humanity which binds us to such men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
But no one, I suppose, will maintain that perfect manliness
would not suppress, at any rate, the open expression
of any such feelings. The man who has to lead a
great revolution should keep all misgivings to himself,
and the weight of them so kept must often prove the
sorest part of his burden.</p>

<p>We have most of us, at one time or another of our
lives, passed through trying ordeals, the memory of
which we can by no means dwell on with pleasure.
Times they were of blinding and driving storm, and
howling winds, out of which voices as of evil spirits
spoke close in our ears—tauntingly, temptingly, whispering
to the mischievous wild beast which lurks in the
bottom of all our hearts—now, “Rouse up! art thou
a man and darest not do this thing;” now, “Rise, kill
and eat—it is thine, wilt thou not take it? Shall the
flimsy scruples of this teacher, or the sanctified cant of
that, bar thy way and balk thee of thine own? Thou
hast strength to have them—to brave all things in
earth or heaven, or hell; put out thy strength, and be a
man!”</p>

<p>Then did not the wild beast within us shake itself,
and feel its power, sweeping away all the “Thou shalt
nots,” which the Law wrote up before us in letters of
fire, with the “I <i>will</i>” of hardy, godless, self-assertion?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
And all the while, which alone made the storm really
dreadful to us, was there not the still small voice,
never to be altogether silenced by the roarings of the
tempest of passion, by the evil voices, by our own
violent attempts to stifle it;—the still small voice
appealing to the man, the true man, within us, which is
made in the image of God, calling on him to assert his
dominion over the wild beast—to obey, and conquer,
and live. Aye! and though we may have followed
other voices, have we not, while following them, confessed
in our hearts that all true strength, and nobleness,
and manliness was to be found in the other path.
Do I say that most of us have had to tread this path
and fight this battle? Surely I might have said all of
us; all, at least, who have passed the bright days of
their boyhood. The clear and keen intellect no less
than the dull and heavy; the weak, the cold, the nervous,
no less than the strong and passionate of body.
The arms and the field have been divers—can have
been the same, I suppose, to no two men, but the battle
must have been the same to all. One here and there may
have had a foretaste of it as a boy; but it is the young
man’s battle, and not the boy’s, thank God for it!
That most hateful and fearful of all relatives, call it by
what name we will—self, the natural man, the old
Adam—must have risen up before each of us in early
manhood, if not sooner, challenging the true man within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
us, to which the Spirit of God is speaking, to a struggle
for life or death.</p>

<p>Gird yourself, then, for the fight, my young brother,
and take up the pledge which was made for you when
you were a helpless child. This world, and all others,
time and eternity, for you hang upon the issue. This
enemy must be met and vanquished—not finally, for
no man while on earth, I suppose, can say that he is
slain; but, when once known and recognized, met and
vanquished he must be, by God’s help, in this and that
encounter, before you can be truly called a man; before
you can really enjoy any one even of this world’s
good things.</p>

<p>In the course of my inquiries on the subject of muscular
Christians, their works and ways, a fact has forced
itself on my attention, which, for the sake of ingenious
youth, ought not to be passed over. I find then, that,
side by side with these muscular Christians, and apparently
claiming some sort of connection with them (the
same concern, as the pirates of trade-marks say) have
risen up another set of persons, against whom I desire
to caution my readers. I must call the persons in question
“musclemen,” as distinguished from muscular
Christians; the only point in common between the two
being that both hold it to be a good thing to have strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and well-exercised bodies, ready to be put at the shortest
notice to any work of which bodies are capable, and to
do it well. Here all likeness ends; for the “muscleman”
seems to have no belief whatever as to the purposes
for which his body has been given him, except
some hazy idea that it is to go up and down the world
with him, belaboring men and captivating women for his
benefit or pleasure, at once the servant and fomenter of
those fierce and brutal passions which he seems to
think it a necessity, and rather a fine thing than otherwise,
to indulge and obey. Whereas, so far as I know,
the least of the muscular Christians has hold of the old
chivalrous and Christian belief, that a man’s body is
given him to be trained and brought into subjection,
and then used for the protection of the weak, the advancement
of all righteous causes, and the subduing
of the earth which God has given to the children of men.
He does not hold that mere strength or activity are in
themselves worthy of any respect or worship, or that one
man is a bit better than another because he can knock
him down, or carry a bigger sack of potatoes than he.
For mere power, whether of body or intellect, he has (I
hope and believe) no reverence whatever, though,
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, he would probably himself, as a matter
of taste prefer the man who can lift a hundred-weight
round his head with his little finger to the man who can
construct a string of perfect Sorites.</p>

never known or counted the perils of the path which
leads to it—which is ready with the prompt response,

<p>How can we be ever on the watch for the evil which
is so near us? We cannot; but one is with us, is in us,
who can and will, if we will let him.</p>

<p>Men found this out in the old time, and have felt it
and known it ever since. Three thousand years ago
this truth dawned upon the old Psalmist, and struck him
with awe. He struggled with it; he tried to escape from
it, but in vain. “Whither shall I go,” he says “from
thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my
bed in hell, behold thou art there. If I take the wings
of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right
hand shall hold me.”</p>

<p>Is any of us stronger or wiser than the Psalmist?
Is there any place for us to flee to, which was not open
to him? My brethren, had we not better make up our
minds to accept and acknowledge the truth, to which
our own consciences bear witness, that not only in
heaven, and in hell, and in the uttermost parts of
sea and earth, He is present, but that in the inmost recesses
of our own hearts there is no escape from his
Spirit—that He is there also, sustaining us, pleading
with us, punishing us.</p>

<p>We know it by the regret we feel for time wasted and
opportunities neglected; by the loathing coming back
to us, time after time, for our every untrue, or mean
thought, word, or deed; by every longing after truth,
and righteousness, and purity, which stirs our sluggish
souls. By all these things, and in a thousand other
ways, we feel it, we know it.</p>

<p>Let us, then, own this and give ourselves up to his
guidance. At first it will be hard work; our will and
spirits will be like a lump of ice in a man’s hand, which
yields but slowly to the warm pressure. But do not despair;
throw yourselves on his guidance, and he will
guide you, he will hide you under his wings, you shall
be safe under his feathers, his faithfulness and truth
shall be your shield and buckler.</p>

<p>The ice will melt into water, and the water will lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
there in the hollow of the hand, moving at the slightest
motion, obeying every impulse which is given to it.</p>

<p>My brethren, the Spirit of God which is in every one
of us—the spirit of truth and love unchangeable—will
take possession of our spirits, if we will but let him, and
turn our whole lives into the lives of children of God,
and joint-heirs of heaven with his Son.</p>

<h2>XXVII.</h2>


<p>“As the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of
God, so it is ever to so much of his attributes as we
bring to it,” may be a startling saying of Mr. Emerson’s,
but is one which commends itself to our experience and
reason, if we only consult them honestly. Let us take
the most obvious examples of this law. Look at the relations
of man to the brute creation. One of us shall
have no difficulty in making friends of beasts and birds,
while another excites their dread and hate, so that even
dogs will scarcely come near him. There is no need
to go back to the traditions of the hermits in the Thebaid,
or St. Francis of Assisi, for instances of the former
class. We all know the story of Cowper and his three
hares, from his exquisite letters and poem, and most of
you must have read, or heard of the terms on which
Waterton lived with the birds and beasts in his Yorkshire
home, and of Thoreau, unable to get rid of wild
squirrels and birds who would come and live with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
or from a boat, taking fish which lay quietly in his hand
till he chose to put them back again into the stream.
But I suppose there is scarcely one of us who has not
himself seen such instances again and again, persons of
whom the old words seemed literally true, “At destruction
and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou
be afraid of the beasts of the earth. For thou shalt be
in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of
the field shall be at peace with thee.”</p>

<p>I remember myself several such; a boy who was
friends even with rats, stoats, and snakes, and generally
had one or other of them in his pockets; a groom upon
whose shoulders the pigeons used to settle, and nestle
against his cheeks, whenever he went out into the stable-yard
or field. Is there any reasonable way of accounting
for this? Only one, I think, which is, that those
who have this power over, and attraction for, animals,
have always felt toward them and treated them as their
Maker intended—have unconsciously, perhaps, but
still faithfully, followed God’s mind in their dealings
with his creatures, and so have stood in true relations
to them all, and have found the beasts of the field at
peace with them.</p>

<p>In the same way the stones of the field are in league
with the geologist, the trees and flowers with the
botanist, the component parts of earth and air with the
chemist, just in so far as each, consciously or unconsciously,
follows God’s methods with them—each part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of his creation yielding up its secrets and its treasures
to the open mind of the humble and patient, who is also
at bottom always the most courageous learner.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXVIII.</h2>


<p>What is true of each of us beyond all question—what
every man who walks with open eyes and open
heart knows to be true of himself—must be true also
of Christ. And so, though we may reject the stories of
the clay birds, which he modeled as a child, taking wing
and bursting into song round him, (as on a par with St.
Francis’ address to his sisters, the swallows, at Alvia, or
the flocks in the marshes of Venice, who thereupon kept
silence from their twitterings and songs till his sermon
was finished), we cannot doubt that in proportion as
Christ was more perfectly in sympathy with God’s
creation than any mediæval saint, or modern naturalist,
or man of science, he had more power than they with
all created things from his earliest youth. Nor could it
be otherwise with the hearts and wills of men. Over
these we know that, from that time to this, he has exercised
a supreme sway, infinitely more wonderful than
that over birds and beasts, because of man’s power of
resistance to the will Christ came to teach and to do,
which exists, so far as we can see, in no other part of
creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>I think, then, it is impossible to resist the conclusion
that he must have had all these powers from his childhood,
that they must have been growing stronger from
day to day, and he, at the same time, more and more
conscious of possessing them, not to use on any impulse
of curiosity or self-will, but only as the voice within
prompted. And it seems the most convincing testimony
to his perfect sonship, manifested in perfect obedience,
that he should never have tested his powers during those
thirty years as he did at once and with perfect confidence
as soon as the call came. Had he done so his
ministry must have commenced sooner; that is to say,
before the method was matured by which he was to reconstruct,
and lift into a new atmosphere and on to a
higher plane, the faith and life of his own nation and of
the whole world. For it is impossible to suppose that
the works which he did, and the words he spoke, at
thirty—which at once threw all Galilee and Judea into
a ferment of hope and joy and doubt and anger—should
have passed unnoticed had they been wrought
and spoken when he was twenty. Here, as in all else,
he waited for God’s mind: and so, when the time for
action came, worked with the power of God. And this
waiting and preparation must have been the supreme
trial of his faith. The holding this position must have
been, in those early years, the holding of the very centre
of the citadel in man’s soul, (as Bunyan so quaintly
terms it), against which the assaults of the tempter must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
have been delivered again and again while the garrison
was in training for the victorious march out into the
open field of the great world, carrying forth the standard
which shall never go back.</p>

<p>And while it may be readily admitted that Christ
wielded a dominion over all created things, as well as
over man, which no other human being has ever approached,
it seems to me to be going quite beyond what
can be proved, or even fairly assumed, to speak of his
miracles as supernatural, in the sense that no man has
ever done, or can ever do, the like. The evidence is
surely all the other way, and seems rather to indicate
that if we could only have lived up to the standard
which we acknowledge in our inmost hearts to be the
true one—could only have obeyed every motion and
warning of the voice of God speaking in our hearts from
the day when we first became conscious of and could
hear it—if, in other words, our wills had from the first
been disciplined, like the will of Christ, so as to be in
perfect accord with the will of God—I see no reason
to doubt that we, too, should have gained the power and
the courage to show signs, or, if you please, to work
miracles, as Christ and his Apostles worked them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXIX.</h2>


<p>Christ’s whole life on earth was the assertion and example
of true manliness—the setting forth in living act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and word what man is meant to be, and how he should
carry himself in this world of God’s—one long campaign,
in which “the temptation” stands out as the first
great battle and victory. The story has depths in it
which we can never fathom, but also clear, sharp lessons
which he who runs may read, and no man can master
too thoroughly. We must follow him reverently into
the wilderness, where he flies from the crowds who are
pressing to the Baptist, and who to-morrow will be
thronging around him, if he goes back among them,
after what the Baptist has said about him to-day.</p>

<p>Day after day in the wilderness the struggle goes on
in his heart. He is faint from insufficient food in those
solitudes, and with bodily weakness the doubts grow
in strength and persistence, and the tempter is always
at his side, soliciting him to end them once for all, by
one act of self-assertion. All those questionings and
misgivings as to his origin and mission which we have
pictured to ourselves as haunting him ever since his
first visit to Jerusalem, are now, as it were, focussed.
There are mocking voices whispering again as of old,
but more scornfully and keenly in his ear, “Are you
really the Messiah, the Son of God, so long looked for?
What more proof have you to go upon than you have
had for these many years, during which you have been
living as a poor peasant in a Galilean village? The
word of this wild man of the wilderness? He is your
own cousin, and a powerful preacher no doubt, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
wayward, wilful man, clad and fed like a madman, who
has been nursing mad fancies from his boyhood, away
from the holy city, the centre of national life and learning.
This sign of a descending dove, and a voice which
no one has heard but yourself? Such signs come to
many—are never wanting when men are ready to deceive
themselves—and each man’s fancy gives them a
different meaning. But the words, and the sign, and
the voice, you say, only meet a conviction which has
been growing these thirty years in your own heart and
conscience? Well, then, at least for the sake of others
if not for your own sake, put this conviction to the
proof, here, at once, and make sure yourself, before you
go forth and deceive poor men, your brethren, to their
ruin. You are famishing here in the wilderness. This,
at least, cannot be what God intends for his Son, who is
to redeem the world. Exercise some control over the
meanest part of your Father’s kingdom. Command
these stones to become bread, and see whether they will
obey you. Cast yourself down from this height. If you
are what you think, your Father’s angels will bear you
up. Then, after they have borne you up, you may go
on with some reasonable assurance that your claim is
not a mere delusion, and that you will not be leading
these poor men whom you call your brethren to misery
and destruction.”</p>

<p>And when neither long fasting and weakness, or
natural doubt, distrust, impatience, or the most subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
suggestions of the tempter, can move his simple trust
in his Father, or wring from him one act of self-assertion,
the enemy changes front and the assault comes
from another quarter. “You may be right,” the voices
seemed now to be saying; “You may not be deceived,
or dreaming, when you claim to be the Son of God, sent
to redeem this fair world, which is now spread out before
you in all its glory. That may be your origin, and
that your work. But, living as you have done till now
in a remote corner of a despised province, you have no
experience or knowledge of the methods or powers
which sway men, and establish and maintain these
kingdoms of the world, the glory of which you are beholding.
These methods and powers have been in use
in your Father’s world, if it be his, ever since man has
known good from evil. You have only to say the word,
and you may use and control these methods and powers
as you please. By their aid you may possibly ‘see of
the travail of your soul and be satisfied;’ without them
you will redeem nothing but perhaps a man here and
there—without them you will postpone instead of
hastening the coming of your Father’s kingdom, to the
sorrow and ruin of many generations, and will die a
foiled and lonely man, crushed by the very forces you
have refused to use for your Father’s service. If they
were wholly evil, wholly unfit for the fulfillment of any
purpose of his, would he have left them in command of
his world till this day? It is only through them that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
world can be subdued. Your time is short, and you
have already wasted much of it, standing shivering on
the brink, and letting the years slip by in that cottage
at Nazareth. The wisest of your ancestors acknowledged
and used them, and spread His kingdom from the
river to the Great Sea. Why should you reject them?”</p>

<p>This, very roughly and inadequately stated, is some
shadow of the utmost part, or skirt as it were, of the
trial-crisis, lasting forty days, through which Christ
passed from his private to his public career. For forty
days the struggle lasted before he could finally realize
and accept his mission with all that it implied. At the
end of that time he has fairly mastered and beaten down
every doubt as to his call, every tempting suggestion to
assert himself, or to accept or use any aid in establishing
his Father’s kingdom which does not clearly bear
his Father’s stamp and seal on the face of it. In the
strength of this victory he returns from the desert, to
take up the burden which has been laid on him, and to
set up God’s kingdom in the world by the methods
which he has learned of God himself—and by no
other.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXX.</h2>


<p>The second period of our Lord’s ministry is one, in
the main, of joyful progress and triumph, in which the
test of true manliness must be more subtle than when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the surroundings are hostile. It consists, I think, at
such times, in the careful watchfulness not to give
wrong impressions, not to mislead those who are touched
by enthusiasm, conscious of new life, grateful to him
who has kindled that life in them.</p>

<p>It is then that the temptation to be all things to all
men in a wrong sense—to adapt and accommodate
teaching and life to a lower standard in order to maintain
a hold upon the masses of average men and women
who have been moved by the words of lips touched by
fire from the altar of God—has generally proved too
much for the best and strongest of the world’s great reformers.
It is scarcely necessary to elaborate this point,
which would, I think, be sorrowfully admitted by those
who have studied most lovingly and carefully the lives
of such men, for instance, as Savonarola or Wesley. If
you will refer to a valuable work on the life of a greater
than either of these, Mr. Bosworth Smith’s “Mohammed
and Mohammedanism,” you will find there perhaps
the best illustration which I can give you of this sad
experience.</p>

<p>When Mohammed returns from Medina, sweeping at
last all enemies out of his path, as the prophet of a new
faith, and the leader of an awakened and repentant people,
his biographer pauses to notice the lowering of the
standard, both in his life and teaching. Power, he
pleads, brings with it new temptations and new failures.
The more thoroughly a man is carried away by his inspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and convinced of the truth and goodness of
his cause and his message, the more likely is he to forget
the means in the end, and to allow the end to justify
whatever means seem to lead to its triumph. He must
maintain as he can, and by any means, his power over
the motley mass of followers that his mission has gathered
round him, and will be apt to aim rather at what
will hold them than at what will satisfy the highest
promptings of his own conscience.</p>

<p>We may allow the plea in such cases, though with
sorrow and humiliation. But the more minutely we examine
the life of Christ the more we shall feel that here
there is no place for it. We shall be impressed with
the entire absence of any such bending to expediency,
or forgetting the means in the end. He never for one
moment accommodates his life or teaching to any
standard but the highest: never lowers or relaxes that
standard by a shade or a hair’s-breadth, to make the
road easy to rich or powerful questioners, or to uphold
the spirit of his poorer followers when they are startled
and uneasy, as they begin half-blindly to recognize what
spirit they are of. This unbending truthfulness is, then,
what we have chiefly to look for in this period of triumphant
progress and success, questioning each act and
word in turn whether there is any swerving in it from
the highest ideal.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2>XXXI.</h2>


<p>We may note that our Lord accepts at once the imprisonment
of the Baptist as the final call to himself.
Gathering, therefore, a few of John’s disciples round
him, and welcoming the restless inquiring crowds who
had been roused by the voice crying in the wilderness,
he stands forward at once to proclaim and explain the
nature of that new kingdom of God, which has now to
be set up in the world. Standing forth alone, on the open
hillside, the young Galilean peasant gives forth the great
proclamation, which by one effort lifted mankind on to
that new and higher ground on which it has been painfully
struggling ever since, but on the whole with sure
though slow success, to plant itself and maintain sure
foothold.</p>

<p>In all history there is no parallel to it. It stands
there, a miracle or sign of God’s reign in this world, far
more wonderful than any of Christ’s miracles of healing.
Unbelievers have been sneering at and ridiculing it, and
Christian doctors paring and explaining it away ever
since. But there it stands, as strong and fresh as ever,
the calm declaration and witness of what mankind is intended
by God to become on this earth of his.</p>

<p>As a question of courageous utterance, I would only
ask you to read it through once more, bearing in mind
who the preacher was—a peasant, already repudiated
by his own neighbors and kinsfolk, and suspected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
national rulers and teachers; and who were the hearers—a
motley crowd of Jewish peasants and fishermen, Romish
legionaries, traders from Damascus, Tyre, and Sidon,
and the distant isles of Greece, with a large sprinkling
of publicans, scribes, Pharisees, and lawyers.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the sermon was to bow the
hearts of this crowd for the time, so that he was able to
choose followers from amongst them, much as he would.
He takes fishermen and peasants, selecting only two at
most, from any rank above the lowest, and one of these
from a class more hated and despised by the Jews
than the poorest peasant, the publicans. It is plain
that he might at first have called apostles from amongst
the upper classes had he desired it—as a teacher with
any want of courage would surely have done. But the
only scribe who offers himself is rejected.</p>

<p>The calling of the Apostles is followed by a succession
of discourses and miracles, which move the people
more and more, until, after that of the loaves, the popular
enthusiasm rises to the point it had so often reached
in the case of other preachers and leaders of this strange
people. They are ready to take him by force and make
him a king.</p>

<p>The Apostles apparently encouraged this enthusiasm,
for which he constrains them into a ship, and sends
them away before him. After rejoining them and rebuking
their want of understanding and faith, he returns
with them to the multitudes, and at once speaks of himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as the bread from heaven, in the discourse which
offends many of his disciples, who from this time go
back and walk no more with him. The brief season of
triumphant progress is drawing to an end, during which
he could rejoice in spirit in contemplating the human
harvest which he and his disciples seem to be already
successfully garnering.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXII.</h2>


<p>The more carefully we study the long wrestle of
Christ with the blind leaders of a doomed nation, the
more we shall recognize the perfect truthfulness, and
therefore the perfect courage, which marks his conduct
of it. From beginning to end there is no word or act
which can mislead friend or foe. The strife, though for
life and death, has left no trace or stain on his nature.
Fresh from the last and final conflict in the temple
court, he can pause on the side of Olivet to weep over
the city, the sight of which can still wring from him the
pathetic yearnings of a soul purified from all taint of
bitterness.</p>

<p>It is this most tender and sensitive of the sons of
men—with fibres answering to every touch and breath
of human sympathy or human hate—who has borne
with absolutely unshaken steadfastness the distrust and
anger of kinsfolk, the ingratitude of converts, the blindness
of disciples, the fitful and purblind worship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hatred, and fear, of the nation of the Jews. So far, we
can estimate to some extent the burden and the strain,
and realize the strength and beauty of the spirit which
could bear it all. Beyond and behind lie depths into
which we can but glance. For in those last hours of
his life on earth the question was to be decided whether
we men have in deed and truth a brotherhood, in a Son
of Man, the head of humanity, who has united mankind
to their Father, and can enable them to know him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXIII.</h2>


<p>It is around the life of the Son of Man and Son of
God that the fiercest controversies of our time are
raging. Is it not also becoming clearer every day that
they will continue to rage more and more fiercely—that
there can be no rest or peace possible for mankind—until
all things are subdued to him, and brought into
harmony with his life?</p>

<p>It is to this work that all churches and sects, that all
the leading nations of the world, known collectively as
Christendom, are pledged: and the time for redeeming
that pledge is running out rapidly, as the distress and
perplexity, the threatening disruption and anarchy of
Christendom too clearly show. It is to this work too
that you and I, every man and woman of us, are also
called; and if we would go about it with any hope and
courage, it can only be by keeping the life of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
vividly before us day by day, and turning to it as to a
fountain in the desert, as to the shadow of a great rock
in a weary land.</p>

<p>From behind the shadow the still small voice—more
awful than tempest or earthquake—more sure and persistent
than day and night—is always sounding, full of
hope and strength to the weariest of us all, “Be of good
cheer, I have overcome the world.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXIV.</h2>


<p>Nicodemus was a leading member of the Sanhedrim,
a representative of that section of the rulers who, like
the rest of the nation, were expecting a deliverer, a
king who should prevail against the Cæsar. They had
sent to the Baptist, and had heard of his testimony to
the young Galilean, who had now come to Jerusalem,
and was showing signs of a power which they could not
but acknowledge. For, had he not cleansed the temple,
which they had never been able to do, but, notwithstanding
their pretended reverence for it, had allowed to be
turned into a shambles and an exchange? They saw
that a part of the people were ready to gather to him,
but that he had refused to commit himself to them.
This, then, the best of them must have felt, was no mere
leader of a low, fierce, popular party or faction. Nicodemus
at any rate was evidently inclined to doubt
whether he might not prove to be the king they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
looking for, as the Baptist had declared. The doubt
must be solved, and he would see for himself.</p>

<p>And so he comes to Christ, and hears directly from
him, that he has indeed come to set up a kingdom, but
that it is no visible kingdom like the Cæsars’, but a
kingdom over men’s spirits, one in which rulers as well
as peasants must become new men before they can
enter—that a light has come into the world, and “he
that doeth truth cometh to that light.”</p>

<p>From beginning to end there is no word to catch this
ruler, or those he represented; no balancing of phrases
or playing with plausible religious shibboleths, with
which Nicodemus would be familiar, and which might
please, and perchance reconcile this well-disposed
ruler, and the powerful persons he represented. There
is, depend upon it, no severer test of manliness than our
behavior to powerful persons, whose aid would advance
the cause we have at heart. We know from the later
records that the interview of that night, and the strange
words he had heard at it, made a deep impression on
this ruler. His manliness, however, breaks down for
the present. He shrinks back and disappears, leaving
the strange young peasant to go on his way.</p>

<p>The same splendid directness and incisiveness characterize
his teaching at Samaria. There, again, He
attacks at once the most cherished local traditions, showing
that the place of worship matters nothing, the object
of worship everything. That object is a Father of men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
spirits, who wills that all men shall know and worship
him, but who can only be worshipped in spirit and in
truth. He, the peasant who is talking to them, is himself
the Messiah, who has come from this Father of them
and him, to give them this spirit of truth in their own
hearts.</p>

<p>The Jews at Jerusalem had been clamoring round him
for signs of his claim to speak such words, and in the
next few days his own people would be crying out for
his blood when they heard them. These Samaritans
make no such demand, but hear and recognize the
message and the messenger. The seed is sown and he
passes on, never to return and garner the harvest; deliberately
preferring the hard, priest-ridden lake-cities
of the Jews as the centre of his ministry. He will leave
ripe fields for others to reap. This decision, interpret it
as we will, is that of no soft or timid reformer. Take
this test and compare Christ’s choice of his first field
for work with that of any other great leader of men.</p>

<p>Happy is the man who is able to follow straight on,
though often wearily and painfully, in the tracks of the
divine ideal who stood by his side in his youth, though
sadly conscious of weary lengths of way, of gulfs and
chasms, which since those days have come to stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
between him and his ideal—of the difference between
the man God meant him to be—of the manhood he
thought he saw so clearly in those early days—and the
man he and the world together managed to make of
him.</p>

<p>I say, happy is that man. I had almost said that no
other than he is happy in any true or noble sense, even
in this hard materialistic nineteenth century, when the
faith, that the weak must go to the wall, that the strong
alone are to survive, prevails as it never did before—which
on the surface seems specially to be organized for
the destruction of ideals and the quenching of enthusiasms.
I feel deeply the responsibility of making <i>any</i>
assertion on so moot a point; nevertheless, even in our
materialistic age, I must urge you all, as you would do
good work in the world, to take your stand resolutely
and once for all, and all your lives through, on the side
of the idealists.</p>

<p>He who has the clearest and intensest vision of what
is at issue in the great battle of life, and who quits himself
in it most manfully, will be the first to acknowledge
that for him there has been no approach to victory
except by the faithful doing day by day of the work
which lay at his own threshold.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the universal experience of mankind—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dreary confession of those who have merely
sought a “low thing,” and “gone on adding one to
one;” making that the aim and object of their lives—unite
in warning us that on these lines no true victory
can be had, either for the man himself or for the cause
he was sent into the world to maintain.</p>

<p>No, there is no victory possible without humility and
magnanimity; and no humility or magnanimity possible
without an ideal. Now there is not one amongst us all
who has not heard the call in his own heart to put aside
all evil habits, and to live a brave, simple, truthful life.
It is no modern, no Christian experience, this. The
choice of Hercules, and numberless other Pagan
stories, the witness of nearly all histories and all literatures,
attest that it is an experience common to all our
race. It is of it that the poet is thinking in those fine
lines of Emerson which are written up in the Hall of
Marlborough College:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“So close is glory to our dust,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So near is God to man—</span></div>
<div class="verse">When duty whispers low, ‘thou must,’</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The youth replies, ‘I can.’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is this whisper, this call, which is the ground of what
I have, for want of a better name, been speaking of as
idealism. Just in so far as one listens to and welcomes
it he is becoming an idealist—one who is rising out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
himself, and into direct contact and communion with
spiritual influences, which even when he shrinks from
them, and tries to put them aside, he feels and knows
to be as real—to be more real than all influences coming
to him from the outside world—one who is bent on
bringing himself and the world into obedience to these
spiritual influences. If he turns to meet the call and
answers ever so feebly and hesitatingly, it becomes
clearer and stronger. He will feel next, that just in so
far as he is becoming loyal to it he is becoming loyal to
his brethren: that he must not only build his own life
up in conformity with its teaching, must not only find
or cut his own way straight to what is fair and true and
noble, but must help on those who are around him and
will come after him, and make the path easier and
plainer for them also.</p>

<p>I have indicated in outline, in a few sentences, a
process which takes a life-time to work out. You all
know too, alas! even those who have already listened
most earnestly to the voice, and followed most faithfully,
how many influences there are about you and within you
which stand across the first steps in the path, and bar
your progress; which are forever dwarfing and distorting
the ideal you are painfully struggling after, and appealing
to the cowardice and laziness and impurity
which are in every one of us, to thwart obedience to the
call. But here, as elsewhere, it is the first step which
costs, and tells. He who has once taken that, consciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and resolutely, has gained a vantage-ground
for all his life.</p>

<p>Our race on both sides of the Atlantic has, for generations,
got and spent money faster than any other, and
this spendthrift habit has had a baleful effect on English
life. It has made it more and more feverish and unsatisfying.
The standard of expenditure has been increasing
by leaps and bounds, and demoralizing trade,
society, every industry, and every profession until a
false ideal has established itself, and the aim of life is
too commonly to get, not to be, while men are valued
more and more for what they have, not for what they
are.</p>

<p>The reaction has, I trust, set in. But the reign of
Mammon will be hard to put down, and all wholesome
influences which can be brought to bear upon that evil
stronghold will be sorely needed.</p>

<p>I say, deliberately, that no man can gauge the value,
at this present critical time, of a steady stream of young
men, flowing into all professions and all industries, who
have learnt resolutely to speak in a society such as ours,
“I can’t afford;” who have been trained to have few
wants and to serve these themselves, so that they may
have always something to spare of power and of means
to help others; who are “careless of the comfits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cushions of life,” and content to leave them to the valets
of all ranks.</p>

<p>And take my word for it, while such young men will
be doing a great work for their country, and restoring
an ideal which has all but faded out, they will be taking
the surest road to all such success as becomes honest
men to achieve, in whatever walk of life they may choose
for themselves.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XXXVIII.</h2>


<p>The first aim for your time and your generation
should be, to foster, each in yourselves, a simple and
self-denying life—your ideal to be a true and useful
one, must have these two characteristics before all
others. Of course purity, courage, truthfulness are as
absolutely necessary as ever, without them there can be
no ideal at all. But as each age and each country has
its own special needs and weaknesses, so the best mind
of its youth should be bent on serving where the need is
sorest, and bringing strength to the weak places. There
will be always crowds ready to fall in with the dapper,
pliant ways which lead most readily to success in every
community. Society has been said to be “always and
everywhere in conspiracy against the true manhood of
every one of its members,” and the saying, though
bitter, contains a sad truth. So the faithful idealist will
have to learn, without arrogance and with perfect good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
temper, to treat society as a child, and never to allow it
to dictate. So treated, society will surely come round
to those who have a high ideal before them, and therefore
firm ground under their feet.</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To pour for thee the cup of honor.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let me say a word or two more on this business of success.
Is it not, after all, the test of true and faithful
work? Must it not be the touchstone of the humble
and magnanimous, as well as of the self-asserting and
ambitious? Undoubtedly; but here again we have to
note that what passes with society for success, and is so
labeled by public opinion, may well be, as often as not
actually is, a bad kind of failure.</p>

<p>Public opinion in our day has, for instance, been
jubilant over the success of those who have started in
life penniless and have made large fortunes. Indeed,
this particular class of self-made men is the one which
we have been of late invited to honor. Before doing
so, however, we shall have to ask with some care, and
bearing in mind Emerson’s warnings, by what method
the fortune has been made. The rapid accumulation of
national wealth in England can scarcely be called a
success by any one who studies the methods by which
it has been made, and its effects on the national character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
It may be otherwise with this or that millionaire,
but each case must be judged on its own merits.</p>

<p>I remember hearing, years ago, of an old merchant
who, on his death-bed, divided the results of long years
of labor, some few hundreds in all, amongst his sons.
“It is little enough, my boys,” were almost his last
words, “but there isn’t a dirty shilling in the whole of
it.” He had been a successful man too, though not in
the “self-made” sense. For his ideal had been, not to
make money, but to keep clean hands. And he had
been faithful to it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XL.</h2>


<p>In reading the stories of many persons whom the
English nation is invited to honor, I am generally struck
with the predominance of the personal element. The
key-note seems generally some resolve taken in early
youth connected with their own temporal advancement.
This one will be Lord Mayor; this other Prime Minister;
a third determines to own a fine estate near the
place of his birth, a fourth to become head of the business
in which he started as an errand-boy. They did
indeed achieve their ends, were faithful to the idea they
had set before themselves as boys; but I doubt if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
can put them anywhere but in the lower school of
idealists. For the predominant motive being self-assertion,
their idealism seems never to have got past
the personal stage, which at best is but a poor business
as compared with the true thing.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XLI.</h2>


<p>Christ is the great idealist. “Be ye perfect as your
Father in heaven is perfect,” is the ideal he sets before
us—the only one which is permanent and all-sufficing.
His own spirit communing with ours is the call which
comes to every human being.</p>

<h2>XLII.</h2>


<p>Blessed is the man who has the gift of making
friends; for it is one of God’s best gifts. It involves
many things, but above all, the power of going out of
one’s self, and seeing and appreciating whatever is noble
and living in another man.</p>

<p>But, even to him who has the gift, it is often a great
puzzle to find out whether a man is really a friend or
not. The following is recommended as a test in the
case of any man about whom you are not quite sure;
especially if he should happen to have more of this
world’s goods, either in the shape of talents, rank,
money, or what not, than you:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Fancy the man stripped stark naked of every thing in
the world, except an old pair of trousers and a shirt,
for decency’s sake, without even a name to him, and
dropped down in the middle of Holborn or Piccadilly.
Would you go up to him then and there, and lead him
out from among the cabs and omnibuses, and take him
to your own home, and feed him, and clothe him, and
stand by him against all the world, to your last sovereign
and your last leg-of-mutton? If you wouldn’t do
this, you have no right to call him by the sacred name
of friend. If you would, the odds are that he would do
the same by you, and you may count yourself a rich
man; for, probably, were friendship expressible by, or
convertible into current coin of the realm, one such
friend would be worth to a man at least £100,000. How
many millionaires are there in England? I can’t even
guess; but more by a good many, I fear, than there are
men who have ten real friends. But friendship is not
so expressible or convertible. It is more precious than
wisdom, and wisdom “can not be gotten for gold, nor
shall rubies be mentioned in comparison thereof.” Not
all the riches that ever came out of earth and sea are
worth the assurance of one such real abiding friendship
in your heart of hearts.</p>

<p>But for the worth of a friendship commonly so called—meaning
thereby a sentiment founded on the good
dinners, good stories, opera stalls, and days’ shooting,
you have gotten or hope to get out of a man, the snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
things in his gift, and his powers of procuring enjoyment
of one kind or another to your miserable body or intellect—why,
such a friendship as that is to be appraised
easily enough, if you find it worth your while; but you
will have to pay your pound of flesh for it one way or
another—you may take your oath of that. If you
follow my advice, you will take a £10 note down, and
retire to your crust of bread and liberty.</p>

<h2>XLIII.</h2>


<p>The idea of entertaining, of being hospitable, is a
pleasant and fascinating one to most young men; but
the act soon gets to be a bore to all but a few curiously
constituted individuals. With these hospitality becomes
first a passion and then a faith—a faith the practice of
which, in the cases of some of its professors, reminds
one strongly of the hints on such subjects scattered
about the New Testament. Most of us feel, when our
friends leave us, a certain sort of satisfaction, not unlike
that of paying a bill; they have been done for, and can’t
expect anything more for a long time. Such thoughts
never occur to your really hospitable man. Long years
of narrow means can not hinder him from keeping open
house for whoever wants to come to him, and setting
the best of everything before all comers. He has no
notion of giving you anything but the best he can command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
He asks himself not, “Ought I to invite A or
B? do I owe him anything?” but, “Would A or B like
to come here?” Give me these men’s houses for real
enjoyment, though you never get anything very choice
there—(how can a man produce old wine who gives his
oldest every day?)—seldom much elbow-room or orderly
arrangement. The high arts of gastronomy and
scientific drinking, so much valued in our highly-civilized
community, are wholly unheeded by him, are altogether
above him, are cultivated, in fact, by quite another set,
who have very little of the genuine spirit of hospitality
in them; from whose tables, should one by chance happen
upon them, one rises, certainly with a feeling of satisfaction
and expansion, chiefly physical, but entirely
without that expansion of heart which one gets at the
scramble of the hospitable man. So that we are driven
to remark, even in such every-day matters as these, that
it is the invisible, the spiritual, which, after all, gives
value and reality even to dinners; and, with Solomon,
to prefer to the most touching <i>diner Russe</i> the dinner of
herbs where love is, though I trust that neither we nor
Solomon should object to well-dressed cutlets with our
salad, if they happen to be going.</p>

<p>There are few of us who do not like to see a man
living a brave and righteous life, so long as he keeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
clear of us; and still fewer who <i>do</i> like to be in constant
contact with one who, not content with so living himself,
is always coming across them, and laying bare to
them their own faint-heartedness, and sloth, and meanness.
The latter, no doubt, inspires the deeper feeling,
and lays hold with a firmer grip of the men he does lay
hold of, but they are few. For men can’t keep always
up to high pressure till they have found firm ground to
build upon, altogether outside of themselves; and it is
hard to be thankful and fair to those who are showing
us, time after time, that our foothold is nothing but
shifting sand.</p>

<p>What man among us all, if he will think the matter
over calmly and fairly, can honestly say that there is
any spot on the earth’s surface in which he has enjoyed
so much real, wholesome, happy life as in a hay field?
He may have won on horseback or on foot at the sports
and pastimes in which Englishmen glory; he may have
shaken off all rivals, time after time, across the vales of
Aylesbury, or of Berks, or any other of our famous hunting
counties; he may have stalked the oldest and shyest
buck in Scotch forests, and killed the biggest salmon of
the year in the Tweed, and trout in the Thames; he
may have made topping averages in first-rate matches
of cricket; or have made long and perilous marches,
dear to memory, over boggy moor, or mountain, or
glacier; he may have successfully attended many
breakfast-parties within drive of Mayfair, on velvet
lawns, surrounded by all the fairy-land of pomp, and
beauty, and luxury, which London can pour out; his
voice may have sounded over hushed audiences at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Stephens or in the law-courts; or he may have had good
times in any other scenes of pleasure or triumph open to
Englishmen; but I much doubt whether, on putting his
recollections fairly and quietly together he would not
say at last that the fresh-mown hay-field is the place
where he has spent the most hours which he would like
to live over again, the fewest which he would wish to
forget.</p>

<p>As children, we stumble about the new-mown hay,
revelling in the many colors of the prostrate grass and
wild flowers, and in the power of tumbling where we
please without hurting ourselves; as small boys, we
pelt one another, and the village school-girls, and our
nurse-maids, and young lady cousins with the hay, till,
hot and weary, we retire to tea or syllabub beneath the
shade of some great oak or elm standing up like a monarch
out of the fair pasture; or, following the mowers,
we rush with eagerness on the treasures disclosed by
the scythe stroke—the nest of the unhappy late-laying
titlark, or careless field-mouse; as big boys, we toil ambitiously
with the spare forks and rakes, or climb into
the wagons and receive with open arms the delicious
load as it is pitched up from below, and rises higher and
higher as we pass along the long lines of haycocks: a
year or two later we are strolling there with our first
sweethearts, our souls and tongues loaded with sweet
thoughts, and soft speeches; we take a turn with the
scythe as the bronzed mosses lie in the shade for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
short rest, and willingly pay our footing for the feat.
Again, we come back with book in pocket, and our own
children tumbling about us as we did before them; now
romping with them, and smothering them with the sweet-smelling
load—now musing and reading and dozing
away the delicious summer evenings. And so shall we
not come back to the end, enjoying as grandfathers the
love-making and the rompings of younger generations
yet?</p>

<p>Were any of us ever really disappointed or melancholy
in a hay-field? Did we ever lie fairly back on a
hay-cock and look up into the blue sky, and listen to
the merry sounds, the whetting of scythes, and the
laughing prattle of women and children, and think evil
thoughts of the world or our brethren? Not we! or, if
we have so done, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves,
and deserve never to be out of town again during hay-harvest.</p>

<p>There is something in the sights and sounds of a hay-field
which seems to touch the same chord in one as
Lowell’s lines in the “Lay of Sir Launfal,” which end:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“For a cap and a bell our lives we pay,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">We wear out our lives with toiling and tasking;</span></div>
<div class="verse">It is only Heaven that is given away;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is only God may be had for the asking.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the philosophy of the hay-field remains to be
written. Let us hope that whoever takes the subject in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hand will not dissipate all its sweetness in the process
of the inquiry wherein the charm lies.</p>

<p>Who among you, dear readers, can appreciate the intense
delight of grassing your first big fish after a nine-months’
fast? All first sensations have their special
pleasure; but none can be named, in a small way, to
beat this of the first fish of the season. The first clean
leg-hit for four in your first match at Lord’s—the
grating of the bows of your racing-boat against the stern
of the boat ahead in your first race—the first half-mile
of a burst from the cover-side in November, when the
hounds in the field ahead may be covered in a tablecloth,
and no one but the huntsman and a top sawyer or
two lies between you and them—the first brief after
your call to the bar, if it comes within the year—the
sensations produced by these are the same in kind; but
cricket, boating, getting briefs, even hunting, lose their
edge as time goes on. But the first fish comes back as
fresh as ever, or ought to come, if all men had their
rights, once in a season. So, good luck to the gentle
craft and its professors, and may the Fates send us
much into their company! The trout-fisher, like the
landscape-painter, haunts the loveliest places of the
earth, and haunts them alone. Solitude, nature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>

<p>How many spots in life are there which will bear
comparison with the beginning of a college boy’s second
term at Oxford? So far as external circumstances are
concerned, it seems hard to know what a man could
find to ask for at that period of his life, if a fairy godmother
were to alight in his rooms and offer him the
usual three wishes. In our second term we are no
longer freshmen, and begin to feel ourselves at home,
while both “smalls” and “greats” are sufficiently distant
to be altogether ignored <b>if</b> we are that way inclined,
or to be looked forward to with confidence that the
game is in our own hands if we are reading men. Our
financial position—unless we have exercised rare ingenuity
in involving ourselves—is all that heart can
desire; we have ample allowances paid in quarterly to
the university bankers without thought or trouble of
ours, and our credit is at its zenith. It is a part of our
recognized duty to repay the hospitality we have received
as freshmen; and all men will be sure to come
to our first parties, to see how we do the thing; it will
be our own fault if we do not keep them in future. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have not had time to injure our characters to any
material extent with the authorities of our own college,
or of the university. Our spirits are never likely to be
higher, or our digestions better. These, and many
other comforts and advantages, environ the fortunate
youth returning to Oxford after his first vacation; thrice
fortunate, however, if it is Easter term to which he is
returning; for that Easter term, with the four days’ vacation,
and little Trinity term at the head of it, is surely
the cream of the Oxford year. Then, even in this our
stern Northern climate, the sun is beginning to have
power, the days have lengthened out, great-coats are unnecessary
at morning chapel, and the miseries of
numbed hands and shivering skins no longer accompany
every pull on the river and canter on Bullingdon. In
Christ-church meadows and the college gardens the
birds are making sweet music in the tall elms. You
may almost hear the thick grass growing, and the buds
on tree and shrub are changing from brown, red, or
purple, to emerald green under your eyes; the glorious
old city is putting on her best looks and bursting out
into laughter and song. In a few weeks the races begin,
and Cowley marsh will be alive with white tents and
joyous cricketers. A quick ear, on the towing-path by
the Gut, may feast at one time on those three sweet
sounds, the thud, thud of the eight-oar, the crack of the
rifles at the Weirs, and the click of the bat on the Magdalen
ground. And then Commemoration rises in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
background, with its clouds of fair visitors, and visions
of excursions to Woodstock and Nuneham in the summer
days—of windows open on to the old quadrangles in
the long still evenings, through which silver laughter
and strains of sweet music, not made by man, steal out
and puzzle the old celibate jackdaws, peering down
from the battlements with heads on one side. To
crown all, long vacation, beginning with the run to
Henley regatta, or up to town to see the match with
Cambridge at Lord’s, and taste some of the sweets of
the season before starting on some pleasure tour or
reading-party, or dropping back into the quiet pleasures
of English country life! Surely the lot of young Englishmen
who frequent our universities is cast in pleasant
places. The country has a right to expect something
from those for whom she finds such a life as this in the
years when enjoyment is keenest.</p>

<p>In all the wide range of accepted British maxims
there is none, take it for all in all, more thoroughly
abominable than the one as to the sowing of wild oats.
Look at it on what side you will, and you can make
nothing but a devil’s maxim of it. What a man—be
he young, old, or middle-aged—sows, <i>that</i>, and nothing
else shall he reap. The one only thing to do with wild
oats is to put them carefully into the hottest part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fire, and get them burnt to dust, every seed of them. If
you sow them, no matter in what ground, up they will
come, with long, tough roots like couch-grass, and luxuriant
stalks and leaves as sure as there is a sun in
heaven—a crop which it makes one’s heart cold to
think of. The devil, too, whose special crop they are,
will see that they thrive, and you, and nobody else will
have to reap them; and no common reaping will get
them out of the soil, which must be dug down deep
again and again. Well for you if, with all your care,
you can make the ground sweet again by your dying
day. “Boys will be boys,” is not much better, but that
has a true side to it; but this encouragement to the
sowing of wild oats is simply devilish, for it means that
a young man is to give way to the temptations and follow
the lusts of his age. What are we to do with the
wild oats of manhood and old age—with ambition,
over-reaching, the false weights, hardness, suspicion, avarice—if
the wild oats of youth are to be sown and not
burnt? What possible distinction can we draw between
them? If we may sow the one, why not the other?</p>

<p>Man of all ages is a selfish animal, and unreasonable
in his selfishness. It takes every one of us in turn many
a shrewd fall, in our wrestlings with the world to convince
us that we are not to have everything our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
way. We are conscious in our inmost souls that man
is the rightful lord of creation; and, starting from this
eternal principle, and ignoring, each man-child of us in
turn, the qualifying truth that it is to man in general, including
women, and not to one man in particular, that
the earth has been given, we set about asserting our
kingships each in his own way, and proclaiming ourselves
kings from our own little ant-hills of thrones. And then
come the struggles and the down-fallings, and some of
us learn our lesson, and some learn it not. But what
lesson? That we have been dreaming in the golden
hours when the vision of a kingdom rose before us?
That there is in short, no kingdom at all, or that, if there
be, we are no heirs of it?</p>

<p>No—I take it that, while we make nothing better
than that out of our lesson, we shall go on spelling at
it and stumbling over it, through all the days of our
life, till we make our last stumble, and take our final
header out of this riddle of a world, which we once
dreamed we were to rule over, exclaiming “<i>vanitas
vanitatum</i>” to the end. But man’s spirit will never be
satisfied without a kingdom, and was never intended to
be satisfied so; and a wiser than Solomon tells us, day
by day, that our kingdom is about us here, and that we
may rise up and pass in when we will at the shining
gates which he holds open, for that it is His, and we are
joint heirs of it with Him.</p>

<p>The world is clear and bright, and ever becoming

Father. To them, and to them alone, is that world,
old and new, given, and all that is in it, fully and freely
to enjoy. All others but these are occupying where they
have no title; “they are sowing much, but bringing in
little; they eat, but have not enough; they drink but
are not filled with drink; they clothe themselves, but
there is none warm; and he of them who earneth wages

<p>The great Danish invasion of England in the ninth
century is one of those facts which meet us at every
turn in the life of the world, raising again and again the
deepest of all questions. At first sight it stands out
simply as the triumph of brute force, cruelty, and anarchy,
over civilization and order. It was eminently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
successful, for the greater part of the kingdom remained
subject to the invaders. In its progress all such civilization
as had taken root in the land was for the time
trodden out; whole districts were depopulated; lands
thrown out of cultivation; churches, abbeys, monasteries,
the houses of nobles and peasants, razed to the
ground; libraries (such as then existed) and works of
art ruthlessly burnt and destroyed. It threw back all
Alfred’s reforms for eight years. To the poor East
Anglian or West Saxon, churl or monk, who had been
living his quiet life there, honestly, and in the fear of
God, according to his lights—to him hiding away in the
swamps of the forest, amongst the swine, running wild
now for lack of herdsmen, and thinking bitterly of the
sack of his home, and murder of his brethren, or of his
wife and children by red-handed Pagans, the heavens
would indeed seem to be shut, and the earth delivered
over to the powers of darkness. Would it not seem so
to us if we were in like case? Have we any faith which
would stand such a strain as that?</p>

<p>Who shall say for himself that he has? And yet what
Christian does not know, in his heart of hearts, that
there is such a faith for himself and for the world—the
faith which must have carried Alfred through those
fearful years, and strengthened him to build up a new
and better England out of the ruins the Danes left behind
them? For, hard as it must be to keep alive any
belief or hope during a time when all around us is reeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and the powers of evil seem to be let loose on the
earth, when we look back upon these “days of the
Lord” there is no truth which stands out more clearly
on the face of history than this, that they all and each
have been working towards order and life, that “the
messengers of death have been messengers of resurrection.”</p>

<p>When the corn and wine and oil, the silver and the
gold, have become the main object of worship—that
which men or nations do above all things desire—sham
work of all kinds, and short cuts, by what we call financing
and the like will be the means by which they will
attempt to gain them.</p>

<p>When that state comes, men who love their country
will welcome Danish invasions, civil wars, potato diseases,
cotton famines, Fenian agitations, whatever
calamity may be needed to awake the higher life again,
and bid the nation arise and live.</p>

<p>That such visitations do come at such times as a
matter of fact is as clear as that in certain states of the
atmosphere we have thunder-storms. The thunder-storm
comes with perfect certainty, and as a part of a natural
and fixed order. We are all agreed upon that now.
We all believe, I suppose, that there is an order—that
there are laws which govern the physical world, asserting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
themselves as much in storm and earthquake as in
the succession of night and day, of seed-time and harvest.
We who are Christians believe that order and
those laws to proceed from God, to be expressions of
His will. Do we not also believe that men are under a
divine order as much as natural things? that there is a
law of righteousness founded on the will of God, as sure
and abiding as the law of gravitation? that this law of
righteousness, this divine order, under which human
beings are living on this earth, must and does assert and
vindicate itself through and by the acts and lives of
men, as surely as the divine order in nature asserts itself
through the agency of the invisible power in earth
and sea and air?</p>

<p>Surely Christianity, whatever else it teaches, at any
rate assures us of this. And when we have made this
faith our own, when we believe it, and not merely believe
that we believe it, we have in our hand the clue to
all human history. Mysteries in abundance will always
remain. We may not be able to trace the workings of
the law of righteousness in the confusions and bewilderments
of our own day, or through the darkness and mist
which shrouds so much of the life of other times and
other races. But we know that it is there, and that it
has its ground in a righteous will, which was the same a
thousand years ago as it is to-day, which every man and
nation can get to know; and just in so far as they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and obey which, will they be founding families, institutions,
states, which will abide.</p>

<p>If we want to test this truth in the most practical
manner, we have only to take any question which has
troubled, or is troubling, statesmen and rulers, and
nations, in our own day. The slavery question is among
the greatest of these. In the divine order, that institution
was not recognized, there was no place at all set
apart for it; on the contrary, He on whose will that
order rests had said that he came to break every yoke.
And so slavery would give our kindred in America no
rest, just as it would give England no rest in the first
thirty years of the century. The nation, desiring to
go on living its life, making money, subduing a continent,</p>

<div class="center">
“Pitching new states as old-world men pitch tents,”
</div>

<p class="unindent">tried every plan for getting rid of the “irrepressible
negro” question, except the only one recognized in the
divine order—that of making him free. The ablest
and most moderate men, the Websters and Clays,
thought and spoke and worked to keep it on its legs.
Missouri compromises were agreed to, “Mason and
Dixon’s lines” laid down, joint committees of both
houses—at last even a “crisis committee,” as it was
called—invented plan after plan to get it finally out of
the way by any means except the only one which the
eternal law, the law of righteousness, prescribed. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he whose will must be done on earth was no party
to Missouri compromises, and Mason and Dixon’s line
was not laid down on his map of North America. And
there never were wanting men who could recognize His
will, and denounce every compromise, every endeavor
to set it aside, or escape from it, as a “covenant with
death and hell.” Despised and persecuted men—Garrisons
and John Browns—were raised up to fight this
battle, with tongue and pen and life’s blood, the weak
things of this world to confound the mighty; men who
could look bravely in the face the whole power and
strength of their nation in the faith of the old prophet:
“Associate yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces;
gather yourselves together and ye shall come to nought,
for God is with us.” And at last the thunder-storm
broke, and when it cleared away the law of righteousness
had asserted itself once again, and the nation was
delivered.</p>

<p>And so it has been, and is, and will be to the end of
time with all nations. We have all our “irrepressible”
questions of one kind or another, more or less urgent,
rising up again and again to torment and baffle us, refusing
to give us any peace until they have been settled
in accordance with the law of righteousness, which is
the will of God. No clever handling of them will put
them to rest. Such work will not last. If we have
wisdom and faith enough amongst us to ascertain and do
that will, we may settle them for ourselves in clear skies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
If not, the clouds will gather, the atmosphere grow heavy,
and the storm break in due course, and they will be
settled for us in ways which we least expect or desire,
for it is “the Lord’s controversy.”</p>

<p>In due course, perhaps! but what if this due course
means lifetimes, centuries? Alas! this is indeed the
cry which has been going up from the poor earth these
thousands of years:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The priests and the rulers are swift to wrong,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the mills of God are slow to grind.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How long, O Lord, how long? The precise times
and seasons man shall never know on this earth.
These the Lord has kept in his own power. But courage,
my brother! Can we not see, the blindest of us,
that the mills are working swiftly, at least in our day?
This is no age in which shams or untruths, whether old
or new, are likely to have a quiet time or a long life of
it. In all departments of human affairs—religious,
political, social—we are travelling fast, in England and
elsewhere, and under the hand and guidance, be sure, of
Him who made the world, and is able and willing to
take care of it. Only let us quit ourselves like men,
trusting to Him to put down whatsoever loveth or
maketh a lie, and in his own time to establish the new
earth in which shall dwell righteousness.</p>

<p>In these days when our wise generation, weighed
down with wealth and its handmaid vices on the one
hand, and exhilarated by some tiny steps it has managed
to make on the threshold of physical knowledge of
various kinds on the other, would seem to be bent on
ignoring its Creator and God altogether—or at least of
utterly denying that he has revealed, or is revealing
himself, unless it be through the laws of nature—one
of the commonest demurrers to Christianity has been,
that it is no faith for fighters, for the men who have had
to do the roughest and hardest work for the world. I
fear that some sections of Christians have been too
ready to allow this demurrer, and fall back on the
Quaker doctrines; admitting thereby that such “Gospel
of the kingdom of heaven” as they can for their part
heartily believe in, and live up to, is after all only a
poor cash-gospel, and cannot bear the dust and dirt, the
glare and horror of battle-fields. Those of us who hold
that man was sent into this earth for the express purpose
of fighting—of uncompromising and unending
fighting with body, intellect, spirit, against whomsoever
and whatsoever causeth or maketh a lie, and therefore,
alas! too often against his brother-man—would, of
course, have to give up Christianity if this were true;
nay, if they did not believe that precisely the contrary
of this is true, that Christ can call them as plainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the drum beating to battle, as in the bell calling to
prayer, can and will be as surely with them in the shock
of angry hosts as in the gathering before the altar. But
without entering further into the great controversy here,
I would ask readers fairly and calmly to consider
whether all the greatest fighting that has been done in
the world has not been done by men who believed, and
showed by their lives that they believed, they had a direct
call from God to do it, and that He was present
with them in their work. And further (as I cheerfully
own that this test would tell as much in favor of Mahommet
as of Cromwell, Gustavus Adolphus, John
Brown) whether, on the whole, Christian nations have
not proved stronger in battle than any others? I would
not press the point unfairly, or overlook such facts as
the rooting out of the British by the West Saxons when
the latter were Pagans; all I maintain is, that faith in
the constant presence of God in and around them has
been the support of those who have shown the strongest
hearts, the least love of ease and life, the least fear of
death and pain.</p>

<p>Supposing the whole Bible, every trace of Christendom
to disappear to-morrow, we should each of us be
conscious of a presence, which we are quite sure is not
ourself, in the deepest recesses of our own heart, communing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
with us there and calling us to take up our two-fold
birthright as man—the mastery over visible
things, and above all the mastery over our own bodies,
actions, thoughts—and the power, always growing, of
a mysterious communion with the invisible.</p>

<h2>LVII.</h2>


<p>“Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?
Even by ruling himself after Thy word.” The question
of questions this, at the most critical time in his life for
every child of Adam who ever grew to manhood on the
face of our planet; and so far as human experience has
yet gone, the answer of answers. Other answers have
been, indeed, forthcoming at all times, and never surely
in greater number or stranger guise than at the present
time: “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his
way?” Even by ruling himself in the faith “that human
life will become more beautiful and more noble in the
future than in the past.” This will be found enough
“to stimulate the forces of the will, and purify the soul
from base passion” urge, with a zeal and ability of
which every Christian must desire to speak with deep
respect, more than one school of our nineteenth century
moralists.</p>

<p>“Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?”
Even by ruling himself on the faith “that it is probable
that God exists, and that death is not the end of life;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or again, “that this is the only world of which we have
any knowledge at all.” Either of these creeds, says the
philosopher of the clubs, if held distinctly as a dogma
and consistently acted on, will be found “capable of
producing results on an astonishing scale.” So one
would think, but scarcely in the direction of personal
holiness, or energy. Meantime, the answer of the
Hebrew psalmist, three thousand years old, or thereabouts,
has gone straight to the heart of many generations,
and I take it will scarcely care to make way for
any solution likely to occur to modern science or philosophy.
Yes, he who has the word of the living God
to rule himself by—who can fall back on the strength
of Him who has had the victory over the world, the
flesh and the devil—may even in this strange disjointed
time of ours carry his manhood pure and unsullied
through the death-grips to which he must come
with “the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the
pride of life.” He who will take the world, the flesh,
and the devil by the throat in his own strength, will find
them shrewd wrestlers. Well for him if he escape with
the stain of the falls which he is too sure to get, and
can rise up still a man, though beaten and shamed, to
meet the same foes in new shapes in his later years.
New shapes, and ever more vile, as the years run on:
“Three sorts of men my soul hateth,” says the son of
Sirach, “a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a
liar, and an old adulterer that doateth.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>We may believe the Gospel history to be a fable, but
who amongst us can deny the fact that each son of man
has to go forth into the wilderness—for us “the wilderness
of the wide world in an atheistic century”—and
there do battle with the tempter as soon as the
whisper has come in his ear: “Thou too art a man; eat
freely. All these things will I give thee.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LVIII.</h2>


<p>“How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I
must be in my Father’s courts, about his business?”</p>

<p>Full of this new question and great wonder, Christ
went home to the village in Galilee with his parents,
and was subject to them; and the curtain falls for us on
his boyhood and youth and early manhood. But as
nothing but what is most important, and necessary for
understanding all of his life which we need for our own
growth into his likeness, is told in these simple gospel
narratives, it would seem that this vivid light is thrown
on that first visit to Jerusalem because it was the crisis
in our Lord’s early life which bears most directly on his
work for our race. If so, we must, I think, allow that
the question, once fairly presented to the boy’s mind,
would never again have left it. Day by day it would
have been coming back with increasing insistency, gathering
power and weight. And as he submitted it day by
day to the God whom prophet and Psalmist had taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
every child of the nation to look upon as “about his
path and about his bed, and knowing every thought of
his heart,” the consciousness must have gained strength
and power. As the habit of self-surrender and simple
obedience to the voice within grew more perfect, and
more a part of his very being, the call must have sounded
more and more clearly.</p>

<p>And, as he was in all things tempted like as we are,
again and again must his human nature have shrunk
back and tried every way of escape from this task, the
call to which was haunting him; while every succeeding
month and year of life must have disclosed to him more
and more of its peril and its hopelessness, as well as of
its majesty.</p>

<p>We have, then, to picture to ourselves this struggle
and discipline going on for eighteen years—the call
sounding continually in his ears, and the boy, the youth,
the strong man, each in turn solicited by the special
temptations of his age, and rising clear above them
through the strength of perfect obedience, the strength
which comes from the daily fulfilment of daily duties—that
“strength in the Lord” which St. Paul holds up to
us as possible for every human being. Think over this
long probation, and satisfy yourselves whether it is easy,
whether it is possible to form any higher ideal of perfect
manliness.</p>

<p>And without any morbid curiosity, and I think with
profit, we may follow out the thoughts which this long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
period of quiet suggests. We know from the evangelists
only this, that he remained in obscurity in a retired
village of Galilee, and subject to his reputed father and
mother. That he also remained in great seclusion while
living the simple peasant life of Nazareth we may infer
from the surprise, not unmixed with anger and alarm,
of his own family, when, after his baptism, he began his
public career amongst them. And yet, on that day,
when he rose to speak in the synagogue, it is clear that
the act was one which commended itself in the first instance
to his family and neighbors. The eyes of all
present were at once fixed on him as on one who might
be expected to stand in the scribe’s place, from whom
they might learn something, a man who had a right to
speak.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is impossible to suppose that he could have
lived in their midst from childhood to full manhood without
attracting the attention, and stirring many questionings
in the minds, of all those with whom he was brought
into contact. The stories in the Apocryphal Gospels of
the exercise of miraculous powers by Christ as a child
and boy may be wholly disregarded; but we may be
sure that such a life as his, though lived in the utmost
possible seclusion, must have impressed every one with
whom he came in contact, from the scribe who taught
the Scriptures in Nazareth to the children who sat by his
side to learn, or met him by chance in the vineyards or
on the hill-sides. That he was diligent in using such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
means for study as were within his reach, if it needed
proof, would appear from his perfect familiarity with the
laws and history of his country at the opening of his
ministry. And the mysterious story of the crisis immediately
following his baptism, in which he wrestled, as it
were, face to face with the tempter and betrayer of mankind,
indicates to us the nature of the daily battle which
he must have been waging, from his earliest infancy, or
at any rate ever since his first visit to Jerusalem. No
one can suppose for a moment that the trial came on
him for the first time after the great prophet to whom
all the nation were flocking had owned him as the coming
Christ. That recognition removed, indeed, the last
doubt from his mind, and gave him the signal for which
he had been patiently waiting, that the time was come
and he must set forth from his retirement. But the assurance
that the call would come at some time must
have been growing on him in all those years, and so
when he does come he is perfectly prepared.</p>

<p>In his first public discourse in the synagogue of Nazareth
we find him at once announcing the fulfilment of the
hopes which all around him were cherishing. He proclaims,
without any preface or hesitation, with the most
perfect directness and confidence, the full gospel of the
kingdom of heaven: “The time is fulfilled, and the
kingdom of God is at hand.” He takes for the text of
his first discourse the passage in Isaiah: “The Spirit of
the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal
the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captive,
the recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them
that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the
Lord,” and proceeds to expound how “this day is this
scripture fulfilled in your ears.” And within the next
few days he delivers his Sermon on the Mount, of which
we have the full record, and in which we find the meaning,
and character, and principles of the kingdom laid
down once and for all. Mark, that there is no hesitation,
no ambiguity, no doubt as to who he is, or what message
he has to deliver. “I have not come to destroy but to
fulfil the law which my Father and your Father has
given you, and which you have misunderstood. This
which I am now unfolding to you is the meaning of that
law, this is the will of my Father who is in heaven.”</p>

<p>Thus he springs at once, as it were, full-armed into
the arena; and it is this thorough mastery of his own
meaning and position from the first—this thorough insight
into what he has to do, and the means by which it
is to be done—upon which we should fix our thoughts
if we want to understand, or to get any notion at all of,
what must have been the training of those eighteen
years.</p>

<p>How had this perfect insight and confidence been
reached? “This young peasant, preaching from a boat
or on a hill-side, sweeps aside at once the traditions of
our most learned doctors, telling us that this, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and our fathers have been taught, is not what the God
of Israel intended in these commandments of his; but
that he, this young man, can tell us what God did really
intend. He assumes to speak to us as one having
authority. Who gave him this authority?” These, we
know, are the kind of questionings with which Christ was
met at once, and over and over again. And they are
most natural and necessary questionings, and must have
occurred to himself again and again, and been answered
by him to himself, before he could have stood up to
proclaim with the tone of absolute authority his good
news to the village congregations in Galilee, or the
crowds on the Mount, or by the lake.</p>

<p>Who gave thee this authority? We can only reverentially,
and at a distance, picture to ourselves the discipline
and struggles by which the answer was reached,
which enabled him to go out without the slightest
faltering or misgiving, and deliver his full and astounding
message, the moment the sign came that the time
had come, and that it was indeed he to whom the task
was intrusted.</p>

<p>But the lines of that discipline, which in a measure is
also the discipline of every one of us, are clearly enough
indicated for us in the story of the temptation.</p>

<p>In every subtle form this question must have been
meeting the maturing Christ day after day. Art thou
indeed the Son of God who is said to be coming to redeem
this enslaved and degraded people, and with and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
beside them all the kingdoms of the world? Even if
these prophets have not been dreaming and doting, art
not thou at least dreaming and doting? At any rate if
that is your claim put it to some test. Satisfy yourself,
and show us, while satisfying yourself, some proof of
your title, which we, too, can recognize. Here are all
these material, visible things which, if your claim be
true, must be subject to you. Show us your power over
some of them—the meanest, if you will, the common
food which keeps men alive. There are spiritual invisible
forces too, which are supposed to be the ministers
of God, and should therefore be under the control of his
Son—give us some sign that you can guide or govern
the least of them. Why pause or delay? Is the burden
growing lighter on this people? Is the Roman getting
year by year less insolent, the publican less fraudulent
and exacting, the Pharisees and rulers less godless, the
people, your own kin amongst them, less degraded and
less brutal? You are a grown man, with the full powers
of a man at any rate. Why are you idling here when
your Father’s work (if God be your Father) lies broadcast
on every side, and no man standing forth to “the
help of the Lord against the mighty,” as our old seers
used to rave?</p>

<p>I hope I may have been able to indicate to you, however
imperfectly, the line of thought which will enable
each of you for yourselves to follow out and realize,
more or less, the power and manliness of the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of Christ implied in this patient waiting in obscurity and
doubt through the years when most men are at full
stretch—waiting for the call which shall convince him
that the voice within has not been a lying voice—and
meantime making himself all that God meant him to be,
without haste and without misgiving.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LIX.</h2>


<p>In Christ, after the discipline of long-waiting years,
there was no ambition, no self-delusion. He had measured
the way, and counted the cost, of lifting his own
people and the world out of bondage to visible things
and false gods, and bringing them to the only Father of
their spirits, into the true kingdom of their God. He
must, indeed, have been well enough aware how infinitely
more fit for the task he himself was than any of his
own brethren in the flesh, with whom he was living day by
day, or of the men of Nazareth with whom he had been
brought up. But he knew also that the same voice
which had been speaking to him, the same wisdom which
had been training him, must have been speaking to and
training other humble and brave souls, wherever there
were open hearts and ears, in the whole Jewish nation.
As the humblest and most guileless of men, he could
not have assumed that no other Israelite had been able
to render that perfect obedience of which he was himself
conscious. And so he may well have hurried to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Jordan in the hope of finding there, in this prophet of
the wilderness, “Him who should come,” the Messiah,
the great deliverer—and of enlisting under his banner,
and rendering him true and loyal service, in the belief
that, after all, he himself might only be intended to aid
and hold up the hands of a greater than himself. For
we must remember that Christ could not have heard before
he came to Bethabara that John had disclaimed the
great title. It was not till the very day before his own
arrival that the Baptist had told the questioners from
Jerusalem, “I am not he.”</p>

<p>But if any such thought had crossed his mind, or hope
filled his heart, on the way to the Baptist, it was soon
dispelled, and he, left again in his own loneliness, now
more clearly than ever before, face to face with the task,
before which even the Son of God, appointed to it before
the world was, might well quail, as it confronted
him in his frail human body. For John recognizes him,
singles him out at once, proclaims to the bystanders,
“This is he! Behold the Lamb of God! This is he
who shall baptize with the fire of God’s own Spirit.
Here is the deliverer whom all our prophets have foretold.”
And by a mysterious outward sign, as well as
by the witness in his own heart and conscience, Christ
is at once assured of the truth of the Baptist’s words—that
it is indeed he himself and no other, and that his
time has surely come.</p>

<p>That he now thoroughly realized the fact for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
time, and was startled and severely tried by the confirmation
of what he must have felt for years to be
probable, is not only what we should look for from our
own experiences, but seems the true inference from the
gospel narratives. For, although as soon as the full
truth breaks upon him he accepts the mission and work
to which God is calling him, and speaks with authority
to the Baptist, “Suffer it to be so now,” yet the immediate
effect of the call is to drive him away into the
wilderness, there in the deepest solitude to think over
once again, and for the last time to wrestle with and
master the tremendous disclosure.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LX.</h2>


<p>In following the life of Christ so far as we have any
materials, we have found one main characteristic to be
patience—a resolute waiting on God’s mind. I have
asked you to test, in every way you can, whether this
kind of patience does not constitute the highest ideal we
can form of human conduct, is not in fact the noblest
type of true manliness. Pursue the same method as to
the isolated section of that life, the temptation, which I
readily admit has much in it that we cannot understand.
But take the story simply as you find it (which is the
only honest method, unless you pass it by altogether,
which would be cowardly) and see whether you can detect
any weakness, any flaw in the perfect manliness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Christ under the strain of which it speaks—whether
he does not here also realize for us the most perfect type
of manliness in times of solitary and critical trial. Spare
no pains, suppress no doubt, only be honest with the
story, and with your own conscience.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any life of first-rate importance to the
world in which we do not find a crisis corresponding to
this, but the nearest parallel must be sought amongst
those men, the greatest of all kind, who have founded
or recast one of the great religions of the world. Of
these (if we except the greatest of all, Moses) Mohammed
is the only one of whose call we know enough to
speak. Whatever we may think of him and the religion
he founded, we shall all probably admit that he was at
any rate a man of the rarest courage. In his case too
it is only at the end of long and solitary vigils in the
desert that the vision comes which seals him for his
work. The silver roll is unfolded before his eyes, and
he who holds it bids him read therein the decree of God,
and tells him, “Thou art the prophet of God, and I his
angel.”</p>

<p>He is unmanned by the vision, and flies trembling to
his wife, whose brave and loving counsel, and those of
his friends and first disciples, scarcely keep him from
despair and suicide.</p>

<p>I would not press the parallel further than to remark
that Christ came out of the temptation with no human
aid, having trod the wine-press alone, serene and resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from that moment for the work to which God had
called him.</p>

<p>The strongest and most generous natures are always
fondest of those who lean on them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXII.</h2>


<p>How utterly inadequate must be any knowledge of a
human being which does not get beneath the surface?
How difficult to do so to any good purpose! For that
“inner,” or “eternal,” or “religious” life (call it which
you will, they all mean the same thing) is so entirely a
matter between each human soul and God, is at best so
feebly and imperfectly expressed by the outer life.</p>

<p>There are none of us but must be living two lives—and
the sooner we come to recognize the fact clearly
the better for us—the one life in the outward material
world, in contact with the things which we can see, and
taste, and handle, which are always changing and passing
away; the other in the invisible, in contact with the
unseen; with that which does not change or pass
away—which is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.
The former life you must share with others, with
your family, your friends, with everyone you meet in
business or pleasure. The latter you must live alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the solitude of your own inmost being, if you can
find no spirit there communing with yours—in the
presence of, and in communion with, the Father of your
spirit, if you are willing to recognize that presence.
The one life will no doubt always be the visible expression
of the other; just as the body is the garment in
which the real man is clothed for his sojourn in time.
But the expression is often little more than a shadow,
unsatisfying, misleading. One of our greatest English
poets has written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The one remains, the many change and pass,</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven’s light forever shines, earth’s shadows fly.</div>
<div class="verse">Time, like a dome of many-colored glass,</div>
<div class="verse">Stains the bright radiance of eternity,</div>
<div class="verse">Until death tramples it to fragments.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so you and I are living now under the dome of
many-colored glass, and shall live as long as we remain
in these bodies, a temporal and an eternal life—“the
next world,” which too many of our teachers speak of
as a place which we shall first enter after death, being
in fact “next” only in the truest sense of the word;
namely, that it is nearest to us now. The dome of time
can do nothing more (if we even allow it to do that)
than partially to conceal from us the light which is always
there, beneath, around, above us.</p>

<p>“The outer life of the devout man,” it has been well
said, “should be thoroughly attractive to others. He
would be simple, honest, straightforward, unpretending,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
gentle, kindly;—his conversation cheerful and sensible;
he would be ready to share in all blameless mirth,
indulgent to all save sin.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXIII.</h2>


<p>In a noisy and confused time like ours, it does seem
to me that most of us have need to be reminded of, and
will be the better for bearing in mind, the reserve of
strength and power which lies quietly at the nation’s
call, outside the whirl and din of public and fashionable
life, and entirely ignored in the columns of the
daily press. There are thousands of Englishmen of
high culture, high courage, high principle, who are living
their own quiet lives in every corner of the kingdom,
from John o’ Groat’s to the Land’s-End, bringing up
their families in the love of God and their neighbor, and
keeping the atmosphere around them clean, and pure,
and strong, by their example—men who would come
to the front, and might be relied on, in any serious
national crisis.</p>

<p>One is too apt to fancy, from the photographs of the
nation’s life which one gets day by day, that the old
ship has lost the ballast which has stood her in such
good stead for a thousand years, and is rolling more and
more helplessly, in a gale which shows no sign of abating,
for her or any other national vessel, until at last
she must roll over and founder. But it is not so. England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is in less stress, and in better trim, than she has
been in many a stiffer gale.</p>

<p>The real fact is, that nations, and the families of
which nations are composed, make no parade or fuss
over that part of their affairs which is going right. National
life depends on home life, and foreign critics are
inclined to take the chronicles of our Divorce Court as
a test by which to judge the standard of our home-life,
like the old gentleman who always spelt through the
police reports to see “what people were about.” An
acquaintance, however, with any average English neighborhood,
or any dozen English families taken at random,
ought to be sufficient to re-assure the faint-hearted, and
to satisfy them that (to use the good old formula) the
Lord has much work yet for the nation to do, and the
national manliness and godliness left to do it all, notwithstanding
superficial appearances.</p>

<h2>LXIV.</h2>


<p>If the angel Gabriel were to come down from heaven,
and head a successful rise against the most abominable
and unrighteous vested interest which this poor world
groans under, he would most certainly lose his character
for many years, probably for centuries, not only with
upholders of said vested interest, but with the respectable
mass of the people whom he had delivered. They
wouldn’t ask him to dinner, or let their names appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
with his in the papers; they would be very careful how
they spoke of him in the Palaver, or at their clubs.
What can we expect, then, when we have only poor,
gallant, blundering men like Kossuth, Garibaldi, Mazzini,
and righteous causes do not always triumph in
their hands; men who have holes enough in their armor,
God knows, easy to be hit by respectabilities sitting in
their lounging-chairs, and having large balances at their
bankers?</p>

<p>But you who only want to have your heads set straight
to take the right side, bear in mind that majorities, especially
respectable ones, are nine times out of ten in
the wrong; and that if you see a man or boy striving
earnestly on the weak side, however wrong-headed or
blundering he may be, you are not to go and join the
cry against him. If you can’t join him and help him,
and make him wiser, at any rate remember that he has
found something in the world which he will fight and
suffer for, which is just what you have got to do for
yourselves; and so think and speak of him tenderly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXV.</h2>


<p>If you have not already felt it, you will assuredly
feel, that your lot is cast in a world which longs for
nothing so much as to succeed in shaking off all belief
in anything which cannot be tested by the senses, and
gauged and measured by the intellect, as the trappings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of a worn-out superstition. Men have been trying, so
runs the new gospel, to live by faith, and not by sight,
ever since there is any record at all of their lives; and
so they have had to manufacture for themselves the
faiths they were to live by. What is called the life of
the soul or spirit, and the life of the understanding, have
been in conflict all this time, and the one has always
been gaining on the other. Stronghold after stronghold
has fallen till it is clear almost to demonstration
that there will soon be no place left for that which was
once deemed all-powerful. The spiritual life can no
longer be led honestly. Man has no knowledge of the
invisible on which he can build. Let him own the truth
and turn to that upon which he <i>can</i> build safely—the
world of matter, his knowledge of which is always growing;
and be content with the things he can see and
taste and handle. Those who are telling you still in
this time that your life can and ought to be lived in
daily communion with the unseen—that so only you
can loyally control the visible—are either wilfully deceiving
you or are dreamers and visionaries.</p>

<p>So the high priests of the new gospel teach, and their
teaching echoes through our literature, and colors the
life of the streets and markets in a thousand ways; and
a mammon-ridden generation, longing to be rid of what
they hope are only certain old and clumsy superstitions—which
they <i>try</i> to believe injurious to others, and
are quite sure make them uneasy in their own efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
eat, drink, and be merry—applauds as openly as it dare,
and hopes soon to see the millennium of the flesh-pots
publicly declared and recognized.</p>

<p>Against which, wherever you may encounter them,
that you may be ready and able to stand fast, is the hope
and prayer of many anxious hearts; in a time, charged
on every side with signs of the passing away of old
things, such as have not been seen above the horizon
in Christendom since Luther nailed his protest on the
church-door of a German village.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXVI.</h2>


<p>The gospel of work is a true gospel, though not the
only one, or the highest, and has been preached in our
day by great teachers. Listen, for instance, to the ring
of it in the rugged and incisive words of one of our
strongest poets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“That low man seeks a little thing to do,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sees it and does it.</span></div>
<div class="verse">This high man, with a great thing to pursue,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dies ere he knows it.</span></div>
<div class="verse">That low man goes on adding one to one,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">His hundreds soon hit.</span></div>
<div class="verse">This high man aiming at a million,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Misses a unit.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sounds like a deliberate attack on the idealist, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
direct preference of low to high aims and standards, of
the seen to the unseen. It is in reality only a wholesome
warning against aiming at any ideal by wrong
methods, though the use of the words “low” and
“high” is no doubt likely to mislead. The true idealist
has no quarrel with the lesson of these lines; indeed,
he would be glad to see them written on one of
the door-posts of every great school, if only they were
ballasted on the other by George Herbert’s quaint and
deeper wisdom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Pitch thy behavior low, thy projects high,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">So shalt thou humble and magnanimous be.</span></div>
<div class="verse">Sink not in spirit: who aimeth at the sky</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shoots higher much than he that means a tree.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both sayings are true, and worth carrying in your
minds as part of their permanent furniture, and you will
find that they will live there very peaceably side by side.</p>

<p>Almost nightly, for years, Tom and Arthur, and by
degrees East occasionally, and sometimes one, sometimes
another of their friends, read a chapter of the
Bible together, and talked it over afterwards. Tom was
at first utterly astonished, and almost shocked, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sort of way in which Arthur read the book and talked
about the men and women whose lives are there told.
The first night they happened to fall on the chapters
about the famine in Egypt, and Arthur began talking
about Joseph as if he were a living statesman; just as
he might have talked about Lord Grey and the Reform
Bill; only that they were much more living realities to
him. The book was to him, Tom saw, the most vivid
and delightful history of real people, who might do
right or wrong, just like any one who was walking about
Rugby—the doctor, or the masters, or the sixth-form
boys. But the atmosphere soon passed off, the scales
seemed to drop from his eyes, and the book became at
once and forever to him the great human and divine
book, and the men and women, whom he had looked
upon as something quite different from himself, became
his friends and counsellors.</p>

<p>Arthur, Tom, and East were together one night, and
read the story of Naaman coming to Elisha to be cured
of his leprosy. When the chapter was finished, Tom
shut his Bible with a slap.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand that fellow Naaman,” said he, “after
what he’d seen and felt, going back again and bowing
himself down in the house of Rimmon, because his effeminate
scoundrel of a master did it. I wonder Elisha
took the trouble to heal him. How he must have despised
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there you go off as usual, with a shell on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
head,” struck in East, who always took the opposite
side to Tom: half from love of argument, half from
conviction. “How do you know he didn’t think better
of it? how do you know his master was a scoundrel?
His letter don’t look like it, and the book don’t say so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” rejoined Tom; “why did Naaman
talk about bowing down, then, if he didn’t mean to do
it? He wasn’t likely to get more in earnest when he
got back to Court, and away from the Prophet.”</p>

<p>“Well, but, Tom,” said Arthur, “look what Elisha
says to him, ‘Go in peace.’ He wouldn’t have said that
if Naaman had been in the wrong.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that that means more than saying,
‘You’re not the man I took you for.’”</p>

<p>“No, no, that won’t do at all,” said East; “read the
words fairly, and take men as you find them. I like
Naaman, and think he was a very fine fellow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Tom, positively.</p>

<p>“Well, I think East is right,” said Arthur; “I can’t
see but what it’s right to do the best you can, though it
mayn’t be the best absolutely. Every man isn’t born to
be a martyr.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said East; “but he’s on one
of his pet hobbies. How often have I told you, Tom,
that you must drive a nail where it’ll go?”</p>

<p>“And how often have I told you,” rejoined Tom,
“that it’ll always go where you want, if you only stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to it and hit hard enough? I hate half-measures and
compromises.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a whole-hog man, is Tom. Must have
the whole animal, hair and teeth, claws and tail,”
laughed East. “Sooner have no bread any day than
half a loaf.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Arthur, “it’s rather puzzling;
but ain’t most right things got by proper compromises,
I mean where the principle isn’t given up?”</p>

<p>“That’s not the point,” said Tom; “I don’t object
to a compromise, where you don’t give up your principle.”</p>

<p>“Not you,” said East laughingly. “I know him of
old, Arthur, and you’ll find him out some day. There
isn’t such a reasonable fellow in the world to hear him
talk. He never wants anything but what’s right and
fair; only when you come to settle what’s right and
fair, it’s everything that he wants, and nothing that you
want. Give me the Brown compromise when I’m on
his side.”</p>

<p>“Now, Harry,” said Tom, “no more chaff—I’m
serious. Look here—this is what makes my blood
tingle;” and he turned over the pages of his Bible and
read: “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and
said to the king, ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful
to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God
whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning,
fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that
we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image
which thou hast set up.’” He read the last verse
twice, emphasizing the nots, and dwelling on them as if
they gave him actual pleasure and were hard to part
with.</p>

<p>They were silent a minute, and then Arthur said,
“Yes, that’s a glorious story, but it don’t prove your
point, Tom, I think. There are times when there is
only one way, and that the highest, and then the men
are found to stand in the breach.”</p>

<p>“There’s always a highest way, and it’s always the
right one,” said Tom. “How many times has the Doctor
told us that in his sermons in the last year I should
like to know!”</p>

<p>“Well, you ain’t going to convince us—is he Arthur?
No Brown compromise to-night,” said East, looking at
his watch. “But it’s past eight, and we must go to
first lesson.”</p>

<p>So they took down their books and fell to work; but
Arthur didn’t forget, and thought long and often over
the conversation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXIII.</h2>


<p>“Tom,” said Arthur, “I’ve had such strange thoughts
about death lately. I’ve never told a soul of them, not
even my mother. Sometimes, I think they’re wrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
but, do you know I don’t think in my heart I could be
sorry at the death of any of my friends.”</p>

<p>Tom was taken quite aback.</p>

<p>“What in the world is the young un after now?”
thought he; “I’ve swallowed a good many of his
crotchets, but this altogether beats me. He can’t be
quite right in his head.”</p>

<p>He didn’t want to say a word, and shifted about uneasily
in the dark; however, Arthur seemed to be waiting
for an answer, so at last he said, “I don’t think I
quite see what you mean, Geordie. One’s told so often
to think about death, that I’ve tried it on sometimes, especially
this last week. But we won’t talk of it now.
I’d better go—you’re getting tired, and I shall do you
harm.”</p>

<p>“No, no, indeed—I ain’t Tom; you must stop till
nine, there’s only twenty minutes. I’ve settled you
must stop till nine. And oh! do let me talk to you—I
must talk to you. I see it’s just as I feared. You
think I’m half-mad—don’t you now?”</p>

<p>“Well, I did think it odd what you said, Geordie, as
you ask me.”</p>

<p>Arthur paused a moment, and then said quickly, “I’ll
tell you how it all happened. At first, when I was sent
to the sick-room, and found I had really got the fever, I
was terribly frightened. I thought I should die, and I
could not face it for a moment. I don’t think it was
sheer cowardice at first, but I thought how hard it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to be taken away from my mother and sisters, and you
all, just as I was beginning to see my way to many
things, and to feel that I might be a man and do a man’s
work. To die without having fought and worked, and
given one’s life away, was too hard to bear. I got terribly
impatient, and accused God of injustice, and strove
to justify myself; and the harder I strove, the deeper I
sank. Then the image of my dear father often came
across me, but I turned from it. Whenever it came, a
heavy numbing throb seemed to take hold of my heart,
and say ‘Dead—dead, dead.’ And I cried out, ‘The
living, the living shall praise thee O God; the dead
cannot praise Thee. There is no work in the grave; in
the night no man can work. But I can work. I can do
great things. I <i>will</i> do great things. Why wilt Thou
slay me.’ And so I struggled and plunged, deeper and
deeper, and went down into a living black tomb. I was
alone there, with no power to stir or think; along with
myself; beyond the reach of all human fellowship; beyond
Christ’s reach, I thought, in my nightmare. You
who are brave and bright and strong, can have no idea
of that agony. Pray to God you never may. Pray as
for your life.”</p>

<p>Arthur stopped—from exhaustion, Tom thought; but
what between his fear lest Arthur should hurt himself,
his awe, and longing for him to go on, he couldn’t ask,
or stir to help him. Presently he went on, but quite
calm and slow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know how long I was in that state. For
more than a day, I know; for I was quite conscious, and
lived my outer life all the time, and took my medicines,
and spoke to my mother, and heard what they said.
But I didn’t take much note of time; I thought time
was over for me, and that that tomb was what was beyond.
Well, on last Sunday morning, as I seemed to
lie in that tomb, alone, as I thought, for ever and ever,
the black, dead wall was cleft in two, and I was caught
up and borne through into the light by some great
power, some living, mighty spirit. Tom, do you remember
the living creatures and the wheels in Ezekiel? It
was just like that: ‘when they went I heard the noise
of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the
voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise
of an host; when they stood they let down their wings’—‘and
they went every one straight forward; whither
the spirit was to go they went, and they turned not
when they went.’ And we rushed through the bright
air, which was full of myriads of living creatures, and
paused on the brink of a great river. And the power
held me up, and I knew that great river was the grave,
and death dwelt there; but not the death I had met in
the black tomb—that I felt was gone forever. For on
the other bank of the great river I saw men and women
and children rising up pure and bright, and the tears
were wiped from their eyes, and they put on glory and
strength, and all weariness and pain fell away. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
beyond were a multitude which no man could number,
and they worked at some great work; and they who rose
from the river went on and joined them in the work.
They all worked, and each worked in a different way,
but all at the same work. And I saw there my father,
and the men in the old town whom I knew when I was
a child; many a hard, stern man, who never came to
church, and whom they called atheist and infidel.
There they were, side by side with my father, whom I
had seen toil and die for them, and women and little
children, and the seal was on the foreheads of all. And
I longed to see what the work was, and could not; so I
tried to plunge in the river, for I thought I would join
them, but I could not. Then I looked about to see how
they got into the river. And this I could not see, but I
saw myriads on this side, and they too worked, and I
knew that it was the same work; and the same seal was
on their foreheads. And though I saw there was toil
and anguish in the work of these, and that most that
were working were blind and feeble, yet I longed no
more to plunge into the river, but more and more to
know what the work was. And as I looked I saw my
mother and my sisters, and I saw the Doctor, and you,
Tom, and hundreds more whom I knew; and at last I
saw myself, too, and I was toiling and doing ever so little
a piece of the great work. Then it all melted away,
and the power left me, and as it left me I thought I
heard a voice say, ‘The vision is for an appointed time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
though it tarry, wait for it, for in the end it shall speak
and not lie, it shall surely come, it shall not tarry.’ It
was early morning I know, then, it was so quiet and
cool, and my mother was fast asleep in the chair by my
bedside; but it wasn’t only a dream of mine. I know
it wasn’t a dream. Then I fell into a deep sleep, and
only woke after afternoon chapel; and the Doctor came
and gave me the sacrament. I told him and my mother
I should get well—I knew I should; but I couldn’t
tell them why. Tom,” said Arthur, gently, after another
minute, “do you see why I could not grieve now to
see my dearest friend die? It can’t be—it isn’t, all
fever or illness. God would never have let me see it so
clear if it wasn’t true. I don’t understand it all yet—it
will take me my life and longer to do that—to find
out what the work is.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Brown! here’s something for you,” called
out the reading man. “Why, your old master, Arnold
of Rugby, is dead.”</p>

<p>Tom’s hand stopped half-way in his cast, and his line
and flies went all tangling round and round his fishing-rod;
you might have knocked him over with a feather.</p>

<p>Neither of his companions took any notice of him,
luckily; and with a violent effort he set to work mechanically
to disentangle his line. He felt completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
carried off his moral and intellectual legs, as if he had
lost his standing-point in the invisible world. Besides
which, the deep loving loyalty he felt for his old leader
made the shock intensely painful. It was the first great
wrench of his life, the first gap which the angel Death
had made in his circle, and he felt numbed, and beaten
down, and spiritless. Well, well! I believe it was good
for him and for many others in like case; who had to
learn by that loss, that the soul of man cannot stand or
lean upon any human prop, however strong, and wise,
and good; but that He upon whom alone it can stand
and lean will knock away all such props in His own
wise and merciful way, until there is no ground or stay
left but Himself, the Rock of Ages, upon whom alone
a sure foundation for every soul of man is laid.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LXXV.</h2>


<p>At the school-gates Tom made a dead pause; there
was not a soul in the quadrangle—all was lonely, and
silent, and sad. So with another effort he strode
through the quadrangle, and into the school-house
offices.</p>

<p>He found the little matron in her room in deep
mourning; shook her hand, tried to talk, and moved
nervously about; she was evidently thinking of the same
subject as he, but he couldn’t begin talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where shall I find Thomas?” said he at last, getting
desperate.</p>

<p>“In the servants’ hall, I think, sir. But won’t you
take anything?” said the matron looking rather disappointed.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said he, and strode off again to
find the old verger, who was sitting in his little den as
of old puzzling over hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>He looked up through his spectacles, as Tom seized
his hand and wrung it.</p>

<p>“Ah! you’ve heard all about it, sir, I see,” said he.</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and then sat down on the shoe-board,
while the old man told his tale, and wiped his spectacles,
and fairly flowed over with quaint, homely, honest
sorrow.</p>

<p>By the time he had done, Tom felt much better.</p>

<p>“Where is he buried, Thomas?” said he at last.</p>

<p>“Under the altar in the chapel, sir,” answered
Thomas. “You’d like to have the key, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Thomas. Yes, I should very much.”
And the old man fumbled among his bunch, and then
got up as though he would go with him; but after a
few steps stopped short and said, “Perhaps you’d like
to go by yourself, sir?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and the bunch of keys were handed to
him with an injunction to be sure and lock the door
after him, and bring them back before eight o’clock.</p>

<p>We walked quickly through the quadrangle and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
into the close. The longing which had been upon him
and driven him thus far, like the gad-fly in the Greek
legends, giving him no rest in mind or body, seemed all
of a sudden not to be satisfied, but to shrivel up, and
pall. “Why should I go on? It is no use,” he thought,
and threw himself at full length on the turf, and looked
vaguely and listlessly at all the well-known objects.
There were a few of the town-boys playing cricket,
their wicket pitched on the best piece in the middle of
the big-side ground, a sin about equal to sacrilege in
the eyes of a captain of the eleven. He was very nearly
getting up to go and send them off. “Pshaw! they
won’t remember me. They’ve more right there than I,”
he muttered. And the thought that his sceptre had departed,
and his mark was wearing out, came home to
him for the first time, and bitterly enough. He was
lying on the very spot where the fights came off; where
he himself had fought six years ago his first and last
battle. He conjured up the scene till he could almost
hear the shouts of the ring, and East’s whisper in his
ear; and looking across the close to the Doctor’s private
door, half-expected to see it open, and the tall
figure in cap and gown come striding under the elm-trees
towards him.</p>

<p>No, no! that sight could never be seen again. There
was no flag flying on the round tower; the school-house
windows were all shuttered up; and when the flag went
up again, and the shutters came down, it would be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
welcome a stranger. All that was left on earth of him
whom he had honored, was lying cold and still under
the chapel-floor. He would go in and see the place
once more, and then leave it once for all. New men
and new methods might do for other people; let those
who would, worship the rising star; he at least would
be faithful to the sun which had set. And so he got
up, and walked to the chapel-door and unlocked it, fancying
himself the only mourner in all the broad land,
and feeding on his own selfish sorrow.</p>

<p>He passed through the vestibule, and then paused for
a moment to glance over the empty benches. His heart
was still proud and high, and he walked up to the seat
which he had last occupied as a sixth-form boy, and sat
himself down there to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>And, truth to tell, they needed collecting and setting
in order not a little. The memories of eight years were
all dancing through his brain, and carrying him about
whither they would; while, beneath them all, his heart
was throbbing with the dull sense of a loss that could
never be made up to him. The rays of the evening
sun came solemnly through the painted windows above
his head, and fell in gorgeous colors on the opposite
wall, and the perfect stillness soothed his spirit by little
and little. And he turned to the pulpit, and looked at
it, and then, leaning forward with his head on his hands,
groaned aloud:</p>

<p>“If he could only have seen the Doctor again for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
five minutes—have told him all that was in his heart,
what he owed to him, how he loved and reverenced
him, and would by God’s help follow his steps in life
and death—he could have borne it all without a murmur.
But that he should have gone away for ever without
knowing it all, was too much to bear.”—“But am
I sure he does not know it all?”—the thought made
him start—“May he not even now be near me, in this
very chapel? If he be, am I sorrowing as he would
have me sorrow—as I should wish to have sorrowed
when I shall meet him again?”</p>

<p>He raised himself up and looked around; and after
a minute rose and walked humbly down to the lowest
bench, and sat down on the very seat which he had occupied
on his first Sunday at Rugby. And then the old
memories rushed back again, but softened and subdued,
and soothing him as he let himself be carried away by
them. And he looked up at the great painted window
above the altar, and remembered how when a little boy
he used to try not to look through it at the elm-trees
and the rocks, before the painted glass came—and the
subscription for the painted glass, and the letter he
wrote home for money to give to it. And there,
down below, was the very name of the boy who sat on
his right hand on that first day, scratched rudely in the
oak paneling.</p>

<p>And then came the thought of all his own school-fellows;
and form after form of boys nobler, and braver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and purer than he, rose up and seemed to rebuke him.
Could he not think of them, and what they had felt and
were feeling, they who had honored and loved from the
first, the man whom he had taken years to know and
love? Could he not think of those yet dearer to him
who was gone, who bore his name and shared his blood,
and were now without a husband or a father? Then
the grief which he began to share with others became
gentle and holy, and he rose up once more, and walked
up the steps to the altar; and while the tears flowed
freely down his cheeks, knelt down humbly and hopefully,
to lay down there his share of a burden which
had proved itself too heavy for him to bear in his own
strength.</p>

<h2>LXXVI.</h2>


<p>“It will be forty years ago next month,” said the old
Captain, “since the ship I was then in came home from
the West Indies station, and was paid off. I had nowhere
in particular to go just then, and so was very
glad to get a letter, the morning after I went ashore at
Portsmouth, asking me to go down to Plymouth for a
week or so. It came from an old sailor, a friend of my
family, who had been Commodore of the fleet. He
lived at Plymouth; he was a thorough old sailor—what
you young men would call ‘an old salt’—and couldn’t
live out of sight of the blue sea and the shipping. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a disease that a good many of us take who have spent
our best years on the sea. I have it myself—a sort of
feeling that we must be under another kind of Providence,
when we look out and see a hill on this side and
a hill on that. It’s wonderful to see the trees come out
and the corn grow, but then it doesn’t come so home to
an old sailor. I know that we’re all just as much under
the Lord’s hand on shore as at sea; but you can’t read
in a book you haven’t been used to, and they that go
down to the sea in ships, they see the works of the
Lord and His wonders in the deep. It isn’t their fault
if they don’t see His wonders on the land so easily as
other people.</p>

<p>“But, for all that, there’s no man enjoys a cruise in the
country more than a sailor. It’s forty years ago since I
started for Plymouth, but I haven’t forgotten the road a
bit, or how beautiful it was; all through the New Forest,
and over Salisbury Plain, and then on by the mail
to Exeter, and through Devonshire. It took me three
days to get to Plymouth, for we didn’t get about so
quick in those days.</p>

<p>“The Commodore was very kind to me when I got
there, and I went about with him to the ships in the
bay, and through the dock-yard, and picked up a good
deal that was of use to me afterwards. I was a lieutenant
in those days, and had seen a good deal of service,
and I found the old Commodore had a great nephew
whom he had adopted, and had set his whole heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
upon. He was an old bachelor himself, but the boy
had come to live with him, and was to go to sea; so he
wanted to put him under some one who would give an
eye to him for the first year or two. He was a light
slip of a boy then, fourteen years old, with deep set
blue eyes and long eyelashes, and cheeks like a girl’s,
but as brave as a lion and as merry as a lark. The old
gentleman was very pleased to see that we took to one
another. We used to bathe and boat together; and he
was never tired of hearing my stories about the great
admirals, and the fleet, and the stations I had been on.</p>

<p>“Well, it was agreed that I should apply for a ship
again directly, and go up to London with a letter to the
Admiralty from the Commodore to help things on.
After a month or two I was appointed to a brig, lying at
Spithead; and so I wrote off to the Commodore, and
he got his boy a midshipman’s berth on board, and
brought him to Portsmouth himself a day or two before
we sailed for the Mediterranean. The old gentleman
came on board to see his boy’s hammock slung,
and went below into the cockpit to make sure that all
was right. He only left us by the pilot-boat when we
were well out in the Channel. He was very low at
parting from his boy, but bore up as well as he could;
and we promised to write to him from Gibraltar, and
as often afterwards as we had a chance.</p>

<p>“I was soon as proud and fond of little Tom Holdsworth
as if he had been my own younger brother, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for that matter, so were all the crew, from our captain
to the cook’s boy. He was such a gallant youngster,
and yet so gentle. In one cutting-out business we had,
he climbed over the boatswain’s shoulders, and was
almost first on deck; how he came out of it without a
scratch I can’t think to this day. But he hadn’t a bit
of bluster in him, and was as kind as a woman to any
one who was wounded or down with sickness.</p>

<p>“After we had been out about a year we were sent to
cruise off Malta, on the look-out for the French fleet.
It was a long business, and the post wasn’t so good then
as it is now. We were sometimes for months without
getting a letter, and knew nothing of what was happening
at home, or anywhere else. We had a sick time too
on board, and at last he got a fever. He bore up against
it like a man, and wouldn’t knock off duty for a long
time. He was midshipman of my watch; so I used to
make him turn in early, and tried to ease things to him
as much as I could; but he didn’t pick up, and I began
to get very anxious about him. I talked to the doctor,
and turned matters over in my own mind, and at last I
came to think he wouldn’t get any better unless he could
sleep out of the cockpit. So one night, the 20th of October
it was—I remember it well enough, better than I
remember any day since; it was a dirty night, blowing
half a gale of wind from the southward, and we were under
close-reefed topsails—I had the first watch, and at
nine o’clock I sent him down to my cabin to sleep there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
where he would be fresher and quieter, and I was to
turn into his hammock when my watch was over.</p>

<p>“I was on deck three hours or so after he went down,
and the weather got dirtier and dirtier, and the scud
drove by, and the wind sang and hummed through the
rigging—it made me melancholy to listen to it. I
could think of nothing but the youngster down below,
and what I should say to his poor old uncle if anything
happened. Well, soon after midnight I went down and
turned into his hammock. I didn’t go to sleep at once,
for I remember very well listening to the creaking of
the ship’s timbers as she rose to the swell, and watching
the lamp, which was slung from the ceiling, and gave
light enough to make out the other hammocks swinging
slowly all together. At last, however, I dropped off, and
I reckon I must have been asleep about an hour, when
I woke with a start. For the first moment I didn’t see
anything but the swinging hammocks and the lamp; but
then suddenly I became aware that some one was standing
by my hammock, and I saw the figure as plainly as
I see any of you now, for the foot of the hammock was
close to the lamp, and the light struck full across on the
head and shoulders, which was all that I could see of
him. There he was, the old Commodore; his grizzled
hair coming out from under a red woollen night cap, and
his shoulders wrapped in an old thread-bare blue dressing-gown
which I had often seen him in. His face
looked pale and drawn, and there was a wistful, disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
look about the eyes. I was so taken aback I
could not speak, but lay watching him. He looked full
at my face once or twice, but didn’t seem to recognize
me; and, just as I was getting back my tongue and going
to speak, he said slowly: ‘Where’s Tom? this is
his hammock. I can’t see Tom;’ and then he looked
vaguely about and passed away somehow, but how I
couldn’t see. In a moment or two I jumped out and hurried
to my cabin, but young Holdsworth was fast asleep.
I sat down, and wrote down just what I had seen,
making a note of the exact time, twenty minutes to two.
I didn’t turn in again, but sat watching the youngster.
When he woke I asked him if he had heard anything of
his great uncle by the last mail. Yes, he had heard;
the old gentleman was rather feeble, but nothing particular
the matter. I kept my own counsel and never
told a soul in the ship; and, when the mail came to
hand a few days afterwards with a letter from the Commodore
to his nephew, dated late in September, saying
that he was well, I thought the figure by my hammock
must have been all my own fancy.</p>

<p>“However, by the next mail came the news of the old
Commodore’s death. ‘It had been a very sudden break-up,’
his executor said. He had left all his property,
which was not much, to his great nephew, who was to
get leave to come home as soon as he could.</p>

<p>“The first time we touched at Malta, Tom Holdsworth
left us and went home. We followed about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
years afterwards, and the first thing I did after landing
was to find out the Commodore’s executor. He was a
quiet, dry little Plymouth lawyer, and very civilly answered
all my questions about the last days of my old
friend. At last I asked him to tell me as near as he
could the time of his death; and he put on his spectacles,
and got his diary, and turned over the leaves. I
was quite nervous till he looked up and said, ‘Twenty-five
minutes to two, sir, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, on the morning of October
21st; or it might be a few minutes later.’</p>

<p>“‘How do you mean, sir?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ he said, ‘it is an odd story. The doctor
was sitting with me, watching the old man, and, as I tell
you, at twenty-five minutes to two, he got up and said it
was all over. We stood together, talking in whispers
for, it might be, four or five minutes, when the body
seemed to move. He was an odd old man, you know,
the Commodore, and we never could get him properly
to bed, but he lay in his red nightcap and old dressing-gown,
with a blanket over him. It was not a pleasant
sight, I can tell you, sir. I don’t think one of you
gentlemen, who are bred to face all manner of dangers,
would have liked it. As I was saying, the body first
moved, and then sat up, propping itself behind with its
hands. The eyes were wide open, and he looked at us
for a moment, and said slowly, “I’ve been to the Mediterranean,
but I didn’t see Tom.” Then the body sank
back again, and this time the old Commodore was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
dead. But it was not a pleasant thing to happen to one,
sir. I do not remember anything like it in my forty
years’ practise.’”</p>

<p>There was a silence of a few seconds after the captain
had finished his story, all the men sitting with eyes fixed
on him, and not a little surprised at the results of their
call. Drysdale was the first to break the silence, which
he did with a long respiration; but, as he did not seem
prepared with any further remark, Tom took up the
running.</p>

<p>“What a strange story,” he said; “and that really
happened to you, Captain Hardy?”</p>

<p>“To me, sir, in the Mediterranean, more than forty
years ago.”</p>

<p>“The strangest thing about it is that the old Commodore
should have managed to get all the way to the
ship, and then not have known where his nephew was,”
said Blake.</p>

<p>“He only knew his nephew’s berth, you see, sir,” said
the Captain.</p>

<p>“But he might have beat about through the ship till
he had found him.”</p>

<p>“You must remember that he was at his last breath,
sir,” said the Captain; “you can’t expect a man to have
his head clear at such a moment.”</p>

<p>“Not a man, perhaps; but I should a ghost,” said
Blake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Time was everything to him,” went on the Captain,
without regarding the interruption, “space nothing.
But the strangest part of it is that I should have seen
the figure at all. It’s true I had been thinking of the
old uncle, because of the boy’s illness; but I can’t suppose
he was thinking of me, and, as I say, he never recognized
me. I have taken a great deal of interest in
such matters since that time, but I have never met with
just such a case as this.”</p>

<p>“No, that is the puzzle. One can fancy his appearing
to his nephew well enough,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“We can’t account for these things, or for a good
many other things which ought to be quite as startling,
only we see them every day.”</p>

<p>Christianity is in no more real danger now than it
was a hundred and fifty years ago, when Dean Swift,
and many other greater wits than we have amongst us
nowadays, thought and said that it was doomed. We
hold in perfect good faith, that the good news our Lord
brought is the best the world will ever hear; that there
has been a revelation in the man Jesus Christ, of God
the Creator of the world as our Father, so that the
humblest and poorest man can know God for all purposes
for which men need to know him in this life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
can have his help in becoming like him, the business
for which they were sent into it: and that there will be
no other revelation, though this one will be, through all
time, unfolding to men more and more of its unspeakable
depth, and glory, and beauty, in external nature, in
human society, in individual men. That, I believe to
be a fair statement of the positive religious belief of average
Englishmen, if they had to think it out and to put
it in words; and all who hold it must of course look
upon Christ’s gospel as the great purifying, reforming,
redeeming power in the world, and desire that it shall
be free to work in their own country on the most favorable
conditions which can be found for it.</p>

<p>We should remember that truth is many-sided; that
all truth comes from one source. There is only one sun
in the heavens, yet, as you know, there are many beautiful
colors, all of which come from the one sun. You
cannot say that the red is better and truer than the
blue, or that the blue is better and truer than the yellow.
You may prefer one to the other; you may see
that one color is more universal, more applicable for
different purposes than another, but there is truth in
each. In the same way there is only one earth, but
there are a great many different trees which grow out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
it, and which derive their nourishment from it; and although
the oak may be very much better suited to
England and the fir to Norway, yet we admit that there
is truth in each; that one is just as good and true a tree
as the other. Therefore, let us who are apt to think in
the church and other religious communities that we have
got all the truth ourselves, remember that truth is wider
than can be apprehended by any body of human beings,
and let us be tolerant to one another, not forgetting that
those who are not in the same community with us hold
their side of the truth as strongly as we do ours.</p>

<p>Each religious community has witnessed, and is witnessing,
to some side of the truth. Religious communities
are not perfect in themselves like trees or flowers,
but for that very reason it is all the more necessary that
the members of them should be tolerant, and should
make the greatest effort to understand those of other
religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I can take little interest in the questions which divide

<p>St. Ambrose was a holy man, and exceeding zealous,
even to slaying for the one true creed. One day as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was walking in deep meditation as to how to bring all
men to his own mind, he was aware of a stream, and a
youth seated beside it. He had never seen so beautiful
a countenance, and sat down by him to speak of those
things on which his mind continually dwelt. To his
horror he found that the beautiful face covered a most
heretical mind, and he spoke in sorrowful anger to the
youth of his danger. Whereupon the young stranger
produced six or seven vases, all of different shapes and
colors, and, as he filled them from the brook, said to the
saint (as the legend is versified by Mr. Lowell):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Now Ambrose, thou maker of creeds, look here—</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As into these vases this water I pour;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One shall hold less, another more,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the water the same in every case,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall take the figure of the vase.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O thou who wouldst unity reach through strife,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Canst thou fit this sign to the Waters of Life.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Ambrose looked up, the youth, the vases, and
the stream were gone; but he knew he had talked with
an angel, and his heart was changed. I wish that
angel would come and do a great deal of preaching to
our English Ambroses.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt,” as Lord Russell says, “that
concession gives rise to demands for fresh concession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and it is right that it should be so. The true limit is,
that all it is just to concede should be conceded; all
that it is true to affirm should be affirmed; but that which
is false should be denied.” Besides this power of concession,
which she has in a much greater degree than
any other religious body, the English Church, if she be
a Catholic Church, as she pretends to be, has also
greater power of assimilation. Let her not be afraid of
those sides of the truth which have been most prominently
put forward by other religious communities. She
can assimilate them if she pleases, and it is her duty to
assimilate whatever is true in them. Her mission in
this world is not to hold her own in the sense of resisting
all reform, of resisting all concession, but her duty and her
mission is to go to the lost people of our country, and
of every country where she is established or where she
exists, and to draw those together into her fold who cannot
get into that of other religious bodies, which have
such limits as I have been speaking of to bar the gates
of admission. Her great mission is to seek and save
those which are lost in every community. The highest
title of her ministers is <i>Servi servorum Dei</i> (the servants
of the servants of God), and, if she remembers this
high mission, if she endeavors by her life to exemplify
her Master’s spirit and to illustrate His life, she never
need be afraid of disestablishment or disendowment.
What did the greatest of churchmen who ever lived say
on the point of people carrying on those miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
squabbles that are dividing us in this day? They were
saying, “We are of Paul,” “We are of Apollos,” “We
are of Peter?” and he said, “Who is Paul? Who is
Apollos? Who is Peter?” If you only understand to
what an inheritance you are called to, “all things are
yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Peter, or the world,
or life, or death, or things present, or things to come,
all are yours, for ye are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.”</p>

<p>It is said by some, as I think, unwise defenders of
the faith, that a colorless Christianity is no Christianity
at all, that you can have no church without a definite
creed. To the first I would reply that, after all, the
bright white light is, in its purity, better than all color.
To the second, I admit that every church must have a
definite creed, but the more simple and broad that creed
is the better. It is only the simplest creed which can
give us the unity, or the tolerance in diversity, for which
all good men are longing.</p>

<p>Meekness, liberality, tolerance of other confessions!
These are great virtues, but hard, very hard to practise
in such hurrying, driving, democratic, competitive times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as ours, when respect for authority seems to have almost
died out. Nevertheless, they must be practised, if the

in a larger and truer sense than she has ever yet been,
“The Church of the People.”</p>

<p>Poor conscience! to what pitiful uses is that sacred
name turned! The stolid Essex peasant, one of the
Peculiar People, lets his child die because he will not
allow it to take medicine, and believes himself to be
suffering for conscience’s sake because he is summoned
before a magistrate to answer for its life. And he has
far more reason on his side than the Ritualist martyrs.
I desire neither to speak nor think scornfully or bitterly
of them, but this at least I must say, that men who can
make matters of conscience of such trivialities as the
shape and color of vestments, the burning of candles
and incense, the position of tables, and the like, and in
defence of these things are prepared to defy authority,
and break what they know to be the law of their country,
are not fit to be trusted with the spiritual guidance
of any portion of our people. England has a great work
still to do in the world, for which she needs children
with quite other kind of consciences than these—consciences
which shall be simple, manly, obedient, qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>

<p>On went the talk and laughter. Two or three of the
little boys in the long dormitory were already in bed,
sitting up with their chins on their knees. The light
burned clear, the noise went on. It was a trying moment
for Arthur, the poor little lonely boy; however,
this time he didn’t ask Tom what he might or might not
do, but dropped on his knees by his bedside, as he had
done every day from his childhood, to open his heart to
Him who heareth the cry and beareth the sorrows of the
tender child, and the strong man in agony....</p>

<p>There were many boys in the room by whom that little
scene was taken to heart before they slept. But sleep
seemed to have deserted the pillow of poor Tom. For
some time his excitement, and the flood of memories
which chased one another through his brain kept him
from thinking or resolving. His head throbbed, his
heart leapt, and he could hardly keep himself from
springing out of bed and rushing about the room. Then
the thought of his own mother came across him, and
the promise he had made at her knee, years ago, never
to forget to kneel by his bedside, and give himself up to
his Father, before he laid his head on the pillow, from
which it might never rise; and he lay down gently and
cried as if his heart would break. He was only fourteen
years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no light act of courage in those days for a little
fellow to say his prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A
few years later, when Arnold’s manly piety had begun
to leaven the school, the tables turned; before he died,
in the school-house, at least, and I believe in the other
houses, the rule was the other way. But poor Tom
had come to school in other times. The first few
nights after he came he did not kneel down because of
the noise, but sat up in bed till the candle was out,
and then stole out and said his prayers, in fear lest
some one should find him out. So did many another
poor little fellow. Then he began to think that he
might just as well say his prayers in bed, and then it
didn’t matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting, or
lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as
with all who will not confess their Lord before men;
and for the last year he had probably not said his
prayers in earnest a dozen times.</p>

<p>Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling which was
likely to break his heart was the sense of his own cowardice.
The vice of all others which he loathed was
brought in and burned in on his own soul. He had
lied to his mother, to his conscience, to his God. How
could he bear it? And then the poor little weak boy,
whom he had pitied and almost scorned for his weakness,
had done that which he, braggart as he was, dared
not do. The first dawn of comfort came to him in
swearing to himself that he would stand by that boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
through thick and thin, and cheer him, and help him,
and bear his burdens, for the good deed done that night.
Then he resolved to write home next day and tell his
mother all, and what a coward her son had been. And
then peace came to him, as he resolved lastly, to bear
his testimony next morning. The morning would be
harder than the night to begin with, but he felt that he
could not afford to let one chance slip. Several times
he faltered, for the devil showed him first all his old
friends calling him “Saint” and “Square-toes,” and a
dozen hard names, and whispered to him that his
motives would be misunderstood, and he would only
be misunderstood, and he would only be left alone with
the new boy; whereas it was his duty to keep all
means of influence, that he might do good to the largest
number. And then came the more subtle temptation,
“Shall I not be showing myself braver than others by
doing this? Have I any right to begin it now? Ought
I not rather to pray in my own study, letting other
boys know that I do so, and trying to lead them to it,
while in public at least I should go on as I have done?”
However, his good angel was too strong that night,
and he turned on his side and slept, tired of trying
to reason, but resolved to follow the impulse which
had been so strong, and in which he had found peace.</p>

<p>Next morning he was up and washed and dressed,
all but his jacket and waistcoat, just as the ten minutes’
bell began to ring, and then in the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
whole room knelt down to pray. Not five words could
he say—the bell mocked him; he was listening for
every whisper in the room—what were they all thinking
of him? He was ashamed to go on kneeling,
ashamed to rise from his knees. At last, as it were
from his inmost heart, a still small voice seemed to
breathe forth the words of the publican, “God be
merciful to me a sinner!” He repeated them over
and over, clinging to them as for his life, and rose
from his knees comforted and humbled, and ready to
face the whole world. It was not needed: two other
boys besides Arthur had already followed his example,
and he went down to the great school with a
glimmering of another lesson in his heart—the lesson
that he who has conquered his own coward spirit has
conquered the whole outward world; and that other
one which the old prophet learned in the cave in
Mount Horeb, when he hid his face, and the still
small voice asked, “What doest thou here, Elijah,”
that however we may fancy ourselves alone on the side
of good, the King and Lord of men is nowhere without
his witnesses; for in every society, however seemingly
corrupt and godless, there are those who have not
bowed the knee to Baal.</p>

<p>“It is about the toughest part of a man’s life, I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
believe,” said Hardy, “the time he has to spend at college.
My university life has been so different altogether
from what yours will be, that my experience isn’t likely
to benefit you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would try me, though,” said Tom; “you
don’t know what a teachable sort of fellow I am, if anybody
will take me the right way. You taught me to
scull, you know; or at least put me in the way to learn.
But sculling, and rowing, and cricket, and all the rest of
it, with such reading as I am likely to do, won’t be
enough. I feel sure of that already.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will,” said Hardy. “No amount of
physical or mental work will fill the vacuum you were
talking of just now. It is the empty house swept and
garnished, which the boy might have had glimpses of,
but the man finds yawning within him, and which must
be filled somehow. It’s a pretty good three-years’ work
to learn how to keep the devils out of it, more or less,
by the time you take your degree. At least I have
found it so.”</p>

<p>Hardy rose and took a turn or two up and down his
room. He was astonished at finding himself talking so
unreservedly to one of whom he knew so little, and
half-wished the words recalled. He lived much alone,
and thought himself morbid and too self-conscious; why
should he be filling a youngster’s head with puzzles?
How did he know that they were thinking of the same
thing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>But the spoken word cannot be recalled; it must go
on its way for good or evil; and this one set the hearer
staring into the ashes, and putting many things together
in his head.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before he broke silence, but at
last he gathered up his thoughts, and said, “Well, I
hope I sha’n’t shirk when the time comes. You don’t
think a fellow need shut himself up, though? I’m sure
I shouldn’t be any the better for that.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you would,” said Hardy.</p>

<p>“Because, you see,” Tom went on, waxing bolder and
more confidential, “if I were to take to moping by myself,
I shouldn’t read as you or any sensible fellow
would do; I know that well enough. I should just
begin, sitting with my legs up on the mantle-piece, and
looking into my own inside. I see you are laughing,
but you know what I mean, don’t you, now?”</p>

<p>“Yes; staring into the vacuum you were talking of
just now; it all comes back to that,” said Hardy.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it does,” said Tom; “and I don’t believe
it does a fellow a bit of good to be thinking about
himself and his own doings.”</p>

<p>“Only he can’t help himself,” said Hardy. “Let
him throw himself as he will into all that is going on
up here, after all he must be alone for a great part of
his time—all night at any rate—and when he gets
his oak sported, it’s all up with him. He must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
looking more or less into his own inside as you call
it.”</p>

<p>“Then I hope he won’t find it as ugly a business
as I do. If he does, I’m sure he can’t be worse
employed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that,” said Hardy; “he can’t learn
anything worth learning in any other way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like that!” said Tom; “it’s worth learning
how to play tennis, and how to speak the truth. You
can’t learn either by thinking about yourself ever so
much.”</p>

<p>“You must know the truth before you can speak
it,” said Hardy.</p>

<p>“So you always do in plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“How?” said Hardy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Tom; “by a sort of instinct,
I suppose. I never in my life felt any doubt about
what I <i>ought</i> to say or do; did you?”</p>

<p>“Well, yours is a good, comfortable, working belief,
at any rate,” said Hardy, smiling; “and I should advise
you to hold on to it as long as you can.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t think I can for very long, eh?”</p>

<p>“No; but men are very different. There’s no saying.
If you were going to get out of the self-dissecting business
altogether though, why should you have brought
the subject up at all to-night? It looks awkward for
you, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Tom began to feel rather forlorn at this suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and probably betrayed it in his face, for Hardy changed
the subject suddenly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say,” said Tom, “that it makes
any real difference to a man in society here in Oxford,
whether he is poor or rich; I mean, of course, if he is a
gentleman and a good fellow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does—the very greatest possible. But
don’t take my word for it. Keep your eyes open and
judge for yourself; I daresay I’m prejudiced on the
subject.”</p>

<p>“Well, I sha’n’t believe it if I can help it,” said Tom;
“you know you said just now that you never called on
any one. Perhaps you don’t give men a fair chance.
They might be glad to know you if you would let them,
and may think it’s your fault that they don’t.”</p>

<p>“Very possibly,” said Hardy; “I tell you not to take
my word for it.”</p>

<p>“It upsets all one’s ideas so,” went on Tom, “why,
Oxford ought to be <i>the</i> place in England where money
should count for nothing. Surely, now, such a man as
Jervis, our captain, has more influence than all the rich
men in the college put together, and is more looked up
to?”</p>

<p>“He’s one of a thousand,” said Hardy; “handsome,
strong, good-tempered, clever, and up to everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Besides, he isn’t a poor man; and mind, I don’t say
that if he were he wouldn’t be where he is. I am speaking
of the rule, and not of the exceptions.”</p>

<p>Here Hardy’s scout came in to say that the Dean
wanted to speak to him. So he put on his cap and
gown, and Tom rose also.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry to turn you out,” said Hardy, “and
I’m afraid I’ve been very surly and made you very uncomfortable.
You won’t come back again in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will though, if you will let me,” said Tom;
“I have enjoyed my evening immensely.”</p>

<p>“Then come whenever you like,” said Hardy.</p>

<p>“But I am afraid of interfering with your reading,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t mind that; I have plenty of time
on my hands; besides, one can’t read all night, and
from eight till ten you’ll find me generally idle.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll see me often enough. But promise,
now, to turn me out whenever I am in the way.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Hardy, laughing; and so they
parted for the time.</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes afterwards Hardy returned to
his room after his interview with the Dean, who merely
wanted to speak to him about some matter of college
business. He flung his cap and gown on to the sofa, and
began to walk up and down his room, at first hurriedly,
but soon with his usual regular tramp. However expressive
a man’s face may be, and however well you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
may know it, it is simply nonsense to say that you can
tell what he is thinking about by looking at it, as many
of us are apt to boast. Still more absurd would it be
to expect readers to know what Hardy is thinking about,
when they have never had the advantage of seeing his
face even in a photograph. Wherefore, it would seem
that the author is bound on such occasions to put his
readers on equal vantage-ground with himself, and not
only to tell them what a man does, but, so far as may be,
what he is thinking about also.</p>

<p>His first thought, then, was one of pleasure at having
been sought out by one who seemed to be just the sort
of friend he would like to have. He contrasted our
hero with the few men with whom he generally lived,
and for some of whom he had a high esteem—whose
only idea of exercise was a two hours’ constitutional
walk in the afternoons, and whose life was chiefly spent
over books and behind sported oaks—and felt that
this was more of a man after his own heart. Then
came doubts whether his new friend would draw back
when he had been up a little longer, and knew more of
the place. At any rate he had said and done nothing
to tempt him; “if he pushes the acquaintance—and I
think he will—it will be because he likes me for myself.
And I can do him good too, I feel sure,” he went on, as
he ran over rapidly his own life for the last three years.
“Perhaps he won’t flounder into all the sloughs that I
have had to drag through; he will get too much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
healthy, active life up here for that, which I never had;
but some of them he must get into. All the companionship
of boating and cricketing, and wine-parties and
supper-parties, and all the reading in the world won’t
keep him from many a long hour of mawkishness, and
discontent, and emptiness of heart; he feels that already
himself. Am I sure of that, though? I may be only
reading myself into him. At any rate, why should I
have helped to trouble him before the time? Was that a
friend’s part? Well, he <i>must</i> face it, and the sooner the
better perhaps. At any rate it is done. But what a
blessed thing if one can only help a youngster like this
to fight his way through the cold clammy atmosphere
which is always hanging over him, and ready to settle
down on him—can help to keep some living faith in
him, that the world, Oxford and all, isn’t a respectable
piece of machinery set going some centuries back!
Ah! it’s an awful business, that temptation to believe,
or think you believe, in a dead God. It has nearly
broken my back a score of times. What are all the
temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil to
this? It includes them all. Well, I believe I can help
him, and, please God, I will, if he will only let me; and
the very sight of him does me good; so I won’t believe
we went down the lasher together for nothing.”</p>

<p>Don’t let reformers of any sort think that they
are going really to lay hold of the working boys and
young men of England by any educational grapnel
whatever, which hasn’t some <i>bona fide</i> equivalent for
the games of the old country “veast” in it; something
to put in the place of the back-swording and
wrestling and racing; something to try the muscles of
men’s bodies, and the endurance of their hearts, and
to make them rejoice in their strength. In all the new-fangled
comprehensive plans which I see, this is all
left out: and the consequence is, that your great
Mechanics’ Institutes end in intellectual priggism, and
your Christian Young Men’s Societies in religious Pharisaism.</p>

<p>Well, well, we must bide our time. Life isn’t all
beer and skittles—but beer and skittles, or something
better of the same sort, must form a good part of every
Englishman’s education. If I could only drive this
into the heads of you rising Parliamentary Lords, and
young swells who “have your ways made for you,” as
the saying is—you, who frequent palaver houses and
West-end Clubs, waiting always to strap yourselves on
to the back of poor dear old John Bull, as soon as the
present used-up lot (your fathers and uncles), who sit
there on the great Parliamentary-majorities’ pack-saddle,
and make believe they’re grinding him with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
red-tape bridle, tumble, or have to be lifted off!</p>

<p>I don’t think much of you yet—I wish I could;
though you do go talking and lecturing up and down
the country to crowded audiences, and are busy with
all sorts of philanthropic intellectualism, and circulating
libraries and museums, and heaven only knows
what besides, and try to make us think, through newspaper
reports, that you are, even as we, of the working
classes. But, bless your hearts, we ain’t so “green,”
though lots of us of all sorts toady you enough certainly,
and try to make you think so.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what to do now: instead of all this
trumpeting and fuss, which is only the old Parliamentary-majority
dodge over again—just you go, each of
you (you’ve plenty of time for it, if you’ll only give up
the other line), and quietly make three or four friends,
real friends, among us. You’ll find a little trouble in
getting at the right sort, because such birds don’t come
lightly to your lure—but found they may be. Take,
say, two out of the professions, lawyer, parson, doctor—which
you will; one out of trade, and three or four out
of the working classes, tailors, engineers, carpenters,
engravers—there’s plenty of choice. Let them be
men of your own ages, mind, and ask them to your
homes; introduce them to your wives and sisters, and
get introduced to theirs; give them good dinners, and
talk to them about what is really at the bottom of your
hearts, and box, and run, and row with them, when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have a chance. Do all this honestly as man to man,
and by the time you come to ride old John, you’ll be
able to do something more than sit on his back, and
may feel his mouth with some stronger bridle than a
red-tape one.</p>

<p>Ah, if you only would! But you have got too far out
of the right rut, I fear. Too much over-civilization,
and the deceitfulness of riches. It is easier for a
camel to go through the eye of a needle. More’s the
pity. I never came across but two of you who could
value a man wholly and solely for what was in him; who
thought themselves verily and indeed of the same flesh
and blood as John Jones, the attorney’s clerk, and Bill
Smith, the costermonger, and could act as if they thought
so.</p>

<p>The change in Tom’s opinions and objects of interest
brought him now into more intimate relations with a set
of whom he had as yet seen little. For want of a better
name, we may call them “the party of progress.” At
their parties, instead of practical jokes, and boisterous
mirth, and talk of boats, and bats, and guns, and
horses, the highest and deepest questions of morals,
and politics, and metaphysics, were discussed, and discussed
with a freshness and enthusiasm which is apt to
wear off when doing has to take the place of talking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
but has a strange charm of its own while it lasts, and is
looked back to with loving regret by those for whom it
is no longer a possibility.</p>

<p>With this set Tom soon fraternized, and drank in
many new ideas, and took to himself also many new
crotchets besides those with which he was really weighted.
Almost all his new acquaintances were Liberal in
politics, but a few only were ready to go all lengths with
him. They were all Union men, and Tom, of course,
followed the fashion, and soon propounded theories in
that institution which gained him the name of Chartist
Brown.</p>

<p>There was a strong mixture of self-conceit in it all.
He had a kind of idea that he had discovered something
which it was creditable to have discovered, and
that it was a very fine thing to have all these feelings
for, and sympathies with, “the masses,” and to believe
in democracy, and “glorious humanity,” and “a good
time coming,” and I know not what other big matters.
And, although it startled and pained him at first to hear
himself called ugly names, which he had hated and
despised from his youth up, and to know that many of
his old acquaintances looked upon him, not simply as a
madman, but as a madman with snobbish proclivities;
yet, when the first plunge was over, there was a good
deal on the other hand which tickled his vanity, and
was far from being unpleasant.</p>

<p>To do him justice, however, the disagreeables were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
such that, had there not been some genuine belief at
the bottom, he would certainly have been headed back
very speedily into the fold of political and social orthodoxy.
As it was, amidst the cloud of sophisms, and
platitudes, and big one-sided ideas half-mastered, which
filled his thoughts and overflowed in his talk, there was
growing in him and taking firmer hold on him daily a
true and broad sympathy for men as men, and especially
for poor men as poor men, and a righteous and burning
hatred against all laws, customs, or notions, which, according
to his light, either were or seemed to be setting
aside, or putting anything else in the place of, or above
the man. It was with him the natural outgrowth of the
child’s and boy’s training (though his father would have
been much astonished to be told so), and the instincts
of those early days were now getting rapidly set into
habits and faiths, and becoming a part of himself.</p>

<p>In this stage of his life, as in so many former ones,
Tom got great help from his intercourse with Hardy,
now the rising tutor of the college. Hardy was travelling
much the same road himself as our hero, but was
somewhat further on, and had come into it from a different
country, and through quite other obstacles. Their
early lives had been so different; and, both by nature
and from long and severe self-restraint and discipline,
Hardy was much the less impetuous and demonstrative
of the two. He did not rush out, therefore (as Tom
was too much inclined to do), the moment he had seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
hold of the end of a new idea which he felt to be good
for <i>him</i> and what <i>he</i> wanted, and brandish it in the face
of all comers, and think himself a traitor to the truth if
he wasn’t trying to make everybody he met with eat it.
Hardy, on the contrary, would test his new idea, and
turn it over, and prove it as far as he could, and try to
get hold of the whole of it, and ruthlessly strip off any
tinsel or rose-pink sentiment with which it might happen
to be mixed up.</p>

<p>Often and often did Tom suffer under this severe
method, and rebel against it, and accuse his friend, both
to his face and in his own secret thought, of coldness, and
want of faith, and all manner of other sins of omission
and commission. In the end, however, he generally
came round, with more or less of rebellion, according to
the severity of the treatment, and acknowledged that,
when Hardy brought him down from riding the high
horse, it was not without good reason, and that the
dust in which he was rolled was always most wholesome
dust.</p>

<p>For instance, there was no phrase more frequently
in the mouths of the party of progress than “the good
cause.” It was a fine big-sounding phrase, which could
be used with great effect in perorations of speeches at
the Union, and was sufficiently indefinite to be easily
defended from ordinary attacks, while it saved him who
used it the trouble of ascertaining accurately for himself
or settling for his hearers what it really did mean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
But, however satisfactory it might be before promiscuous
audiences, and so long as vehement assertion or declaration
was all that was required to uphold it, this same
“good cause” was liable to come to much grief when it
had to get itself defined. Hardy was particularly given
to persecution on this subject, when he could get Tom,
and, perhaps, one or two others, in a quiet room by
themselves. While professing the utmost sympathy for
“the good cause,” and a hope as strong as theirs that
all its enemies might find themselves suspended to
lamp-posts as soon as possible, he would pursue it into
corners from which escape was most difficult, asking it
and its supporters what it exactly was, and driving them
from one cloud-land to another, and from “the good
cause” to the “people’s cause,” “the cause of labor,”
and other like troublesome definitions, until the great
idea seemed to have no shape or existence any longer
even in their own brains.</p>

<p>But Hardy’s persecution, provoking as it was for the
time, never went to the undermining of any real conviction
in the minds of his juniors, or the shaking of
anything which did not need shaking, but only helped
them to clear their ideas and brains as to what they were
talking and thinking about, and gave them glimpses—soon
clouded over again, but most useful, nevertheless—of
the truth, that there were a good many knotty
questions to be solved before a man could be quite sure
that he had found out the way to set the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
thoroughly to rights, and heal all the ills that flesh is
heir to.</p>

<p>Hardy treated another of his friend’s most favorite
notions even with less respect than this one of “the
good cause.” Democracy, that “universal democracy,”
which their favorite author had recently declared to
be “an inevitable fact of the days in which we live,”
was, perhaps, on the whole the pet idea of the small
section of liberal young Oxford, with whom Tom was
now hand and glove. They lost no opportunity of
worshipping it, and doing battle for it; and, indeed, did
most of them very truly believe that that state of the
world which this universal democracy was to bring about
and which was coming no man could say how soon,
was to be in fact that age of peace and good-will which
men had dreamt of in all times, when the lion should
lie down with the kid, and nation should not vex nation
any more.</p>

<p>After hearing something to this effect from Tom on
several occasions, Hardy cunningly lured him to his
rooms on the pretence of talking over the prospects of
the boat club, and then, having seated him by the fire,
which he himself proceeded to assault gently with the
poker, propounded suddenly to him the question:</p>

<p>“Brown, I should like to know what you mean by
‘democracy?’”</p>

<p>Tom at once saw the trap into which he had fallen,
and made several efforts to break away, but unsuccessfully;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and, being seated to a cup of tea, and allowed to
smoke, was then and there grievously oppressed, and
mangled, and sat upon, by his oldest and best friend.
He took his ground carefully, and propounded only what
he felt sure that Hardy himself would at once accept—what
no man of any worth could possibly take exception
to. “He meant much more,” he said, “than this; but
for the present purpose it would be enough for him to
say that, whatever else it might mean, democracy in his
mouth always meant that every man should have a
share in the government of his country.”</p>

<p>Hardy, seeming to acquiesce, and making a sudden
change in the subject of their talk, decoyed his innocent
guest away from the thought of democracy for a
few minutes, by holding up to him the flag of hero-worship,
in which worship Tom was, of course, a sedulous
believer. Then, having involved him in most
difficult country, his persecutor opened fire upon him
from masked batteries of the most deadly kind, the guns
being all from the armory of his own prophets.</p>

<p>“You long for the rule of the ablest man, everywhere,
at all times? To find your ablest man, and then give
him power, and obey him—that you hold to be about
the highest act of wisdom which a nation can be capable
of?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and you know you believe that too, Hardy,
just as firmly as I do.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. But then, how about our universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
democracy, and every man having a share in the government
of his country?”</p>

<p>Tom felt that his flank was turned; in fact, the contrast
of his two beliefs had never struck him vividly
before, and he was consequently much confused. But
Hardy went on tapping a big coal gently with the poker,
and gave him time to recover himself and collect his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean, of course, that every man is to have
an actual share in the government,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“But every man is somehow to have a share; and, if
not an actual one, I can’t see what the proposition
comes to.”</p>

<p>“I call it having a share in the government when a
man has share in saying who shall govern him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll own that’s a very different thing. But,
let’s see; will that find our wisest governor for us—letting
all the foolishest men in the nation have a say as
to who he is to be?”</p>

<p>“Come now, Hardy, I’ve heard you say that you are
for manhood suffrage.”</p>

<p>“That’s another question; you let in another idea
there. At present we are considering whether the <i>vox
populi</i> is the best test for finding your best man. I’m
afraid all history is against you.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good joke. Now, there I defy you, Hardy.”</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning, then, and let us see.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll say, then, that the Egyptian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Babylonian empires were better than the little Jewish
republic.”</p>

<p>“Republic! well, let that pass. But I never heard
that the Jews elected Moses, or any of the judges.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind the Jews; they’re an exceptional
case: you can’t argue from them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t admit that. I believe just the contrary.
But go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what do you say to the glorious Greek
republics, with Athens at the head of them?”</p>

<p>“I say that no nation ever treated their best men so
badly. I see I must put on a lecture in Aristophanes
for your special benefit. Vain, irritable, shallow, suspicious
old Demus, with his two oboli in his cheek, and
doubting only between Cleon and the sausage-seller,
which he shall choose for his wisest man—not to
govern, but to serve his whims and caprices. You must
call another witness, I think.”</p>

<p>“But that’s a caricature.”</p>

<p>“Take the picture, then, out of Thucydides, Plato,
Xenophon, how you will—you won’t mend the matter
much. You shouldn’t go so fast, Brown; you won’t
mind my saying so, I know. You don’t get clear in your
own mind before you pitch into every one who comes
across you, and so do your own side (which I admit is
mostly the right one) more harm than good.”</p>

<p>Tom couldn’t stand being put down so summarily,
and fought over the ground from one country to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
from Rome to the United States, with all the arguments
he could muster, but with little success. That unfortunate
first admission of his, he felt it throughout, like a
mill-stone round his neck, and could not help admitting
to himself, when he left, that there was a good deal in
Hardy’s concluding remark: “You’ll find it rather a
tough business to get your ‘universal democracy,’ and
‘government by the wisest,’ to pull together in one
coach.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all such occasional reverses and cold
baths, however, Tom went on strengthening himself in
his new opinions, and maintaining them with all the zeal
of a convert. The shelves of his bookcase, and the
walls of his room, soon began to show signs of the
change which was taking place in his ways of looking at
men and things. Hitherto a framed engraving of
George III. had hung over his mantel-piece; but early
in this, his third year, the frame had disappeared for a
few days, and when it reappeared, the solemn face of
John Milton looked out from it, while the honest monarch
had retired into a portfolio. A facsimile of Magna
Charta soon displaced a large colored print of “A Day
with the Pycheley;” and soon afterwards the death-warrant
of Charles I., with its grim and resolute rows of
signatures and seals, appeared on the wall in a place of
honor, in the neighborhood of Milton.</p>

<p>“I can’t for the life of me fancy, I confess,” wrote
Tom, “what you think will come of speculating about
necessity and free will. I only know that I can hold
out my hand before me, and can move it to the right or
left, despite of all powers in heaven or earth. As I sit
here writing to you I can let into my heart, and give the
reins to, all sorts of devils’ passions, or to the Spirit of
God. Well, that’s enough for me. I <i>know</i> it of myself,
and I believe you know it of yourself, and everybody
knows it of themselves or himself; and why you can’t
be satisfied with that, passes my comprehension. As if
one hasn’t got puzzles enough, and bothers enough,
under one’s nose, without going afield after a lot of
metaphysical quibbles. No, I’m wrong—not going
afield—anything one has to go afield for is all right.
What a fellow meets outside himself he isn’t responsible
for, and must do the best he can with. But to go on
forever looking inside of one’s self, and groping about
amongst one’s own sensations, and ideas, and whimsies
of one kind and another, I can’t conceive a poorer line
of business than that. Don’t you get into it now, that’s
a dear boy.</p>

<p>“Very likely you’ll tell me you can’t help it; that
every one has his own difficulties, and must fight them
out, and that mine are one sort, and yours another.
Well, perhaps you may be right. I hope I’m getting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
know that my plummet isn’t to measure all the world.
But it does seem a pity that men shouldn’t be thinking
about how to cure some of the wrongs which poor dear
old England is pretty near dying of, instead of taking
the edge off their brains, and spending all their steam
in speculating about all kinds of things, which wouldn’t
make any poor man in the world—or rich one either,
for that matter—a bit better off, if they were all found
out, and settled to-morrow.”</p>

<h2>XCIII.</h2>


<p>William Cobbett was born in 1762 at Farnham, the
third son of a small farmer, honest, industrious, and
frugal, from whom, as his famous son writes, “if he
derived no honor, he derived no shame,” and who used
to boast that he had four boys, the eldest but fifteen,
who did as much work as any three men in the parish
of Farnham. “When I first trudged afield,” William
writes, “with my wooden bottle and satchel slung over
my shoulder, I was hardly able to climb the gates and
stiles.” From driving the small birds from the turnip-seed
and rooks from the peas, he rose to weeding wheat,
hoeing peas, and so up to driving the plough for 2<i>d.</i> a
day, which paid for the evening school where he learned
to read and write, getting in this rough way the rudiments
of an education over which he rejoices as he contrasts
it triumphantly with that of the “frivolous idiots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that are turned out from Winchester and Westminster
Schools, or from those dens of dunces called Colleges
and Universities,” as having given him the ability to become
“one of the greatest terrors to one of the greatest
and most powerful bodies of knaves and fools that
were ever permitted to afflict this or any other country.”</p>

<p>At eleven he was employed in clipping the boxedgings
in the gardens of Farnham Castle, and, hearing
from one of the gardeners of the glories of Kew, he
started for that place with 1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> in his pocket, 3<i>d.</i> of
which sum he spent in buying “Swift’s Tale of a Tub.”
The book produced a “birth of intellect” in the little
rustic. He carried it with him wherever he went, and
at twenty-four lost it in a box which fell overboard in
the Bay of Fundy, a “loss which gave me greater pain
than I have ever felt at losing thousands of pounds.”
He returned home, and continued to work for his father
till 1782, attending fairs and hearing Washington’s
health proposed by his father at farmers’ ordinaries.
In that year he went on a visit to Portsmouth, saw the
sea for the first time, and was with difficulty hindered
from taking service at once on board a man-of-war. He
returned home “spoilt for a farmer,” and next year
started for London. He served in a solicitor’s office in
Gray’s Inn for eight months (where he worked hard at
grammar), then enlisted in the 54th regiment, and after
a few weeks’ drill at Chatham embarked for Nova
Scotia, where the corps were serving. Here his temperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
habits, strict performance of duty, and masterly
ability and intelligence, raised him in little more than a
year to the post of sergeant-major over the heads of
fifty comrades his seniors in service. His few spare
hours were spent in hard study, especially in acquiring
a thorough mastery of grammar. He had bought
Lowth’s Grammar, which he wrote out two or three
times, got it by heart, and imposed on himself the task
of saying it over to himself every time he was posted
sentinel. When he had thoroughly mastered it, and
could write with ease and correctness, he turned to
logic, rhetoric, geometry, French, to Vauban’s fortification,
and books on military exercise and evolutions.
In this way, by the year 1791, when the 54th was recalled,
he had become the most trusted man in the regiment.
The colonel used him as a sort of second adjutant;
all the paymaster’s accounts were prepared by
him; he coached the officers, and used to make out
cards with the words of command for many of them,
who, on parade, as he scornfully writes, “were commanding
me to move my hands and feet in words I had
taught them, and were in everything except mere authority
my inferiors, and ought to have been commanded by
me.” Notwithstanding the masterfulness already showing
itself, Cobbett was a strictly obedient soldier, and
left the army with the offer of a commission, and the
highest character for ability and zeal.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, was his discharge accomplished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
than he set himself to work to expose and bring to
justice several of the officers of his regiment, who had
systematically mulcted the soldiers in their companies
of their wretched pay. His thorough knowledge of the
regimental accounts made him a formidable accuser;
and, after looking into the matter, the then Judge-Advocate-General
agreed to prosecute, and a court-martial
was summoned at Woolwich for the purpose in 1792.
But Cobbett did not appear. He found that it would
be necessary to call his clerks, still serving in the regiment,
and the consequences to them in those days were
likely to be so serious, that he preferred to abandon his
attempt. Accordingly, he did not appear, and the fact
was bitterly used against him in later days by his political
opponents. The whole story is worth reading, and
is very fairly given by Mr. Smith. He had now made a
happy marriage with the girl to whom he had entrusted
all his savings years before, and started with her to
Paris; but, hearing on the way of the king’s dethronement,
and the Bastile riots, he turned aside and embarked
for America.</p>

<p>He arrived in Philadelphia in October 1792, enthusiastic
for the land of liberty, and an ardent student of
Paine’s works, and set to work to gain his living by
teaching English to the French emigrants there, and by
such literary work as he could get. In both he was
very successful, but soon found himself in fierce antagonism
with the American press, and, after publishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
several pamphlets, “A Kick for a Bite,” “A Bone to
Gnaw for the Democrats,” &amp;c., established his first
famous periodical, “Peter Porcupine,” which soon
gained him the reputation in England as well as
America of a staunch and able loyalist, and severe critic
of Republican institutions. The only serious mistake
in his American career was his attack on Dr. Priestly,
then also an emigrant in Philadelphia. The States had
become an undesirable place of residence for him
before 1798, when an intimation reached him through
the British Embassy that the English Government were
sensible of the obligations they owed him, and were
prepared to advance his interests. These overtures he
steadily refused; but, finding a Royalist’s life was
becoming too hot, and having been beaten in a libel
suit, which nearly ruined him (though his expenses were
nominally defrayed by the subscriptions of his American
admirers), he closed the brilliant career of “Peter
Porcupine’s Gazette,” and returned to England, having
at last, to use his own phrase, “got the better of all
diffidence in my own capacity.”</p>

<p>He reached home in 1800, and found himself at once
courted and famous. He was entertained by Ministers
of State and publishers, but after looking round him in
his own sturdy fashion, and finding the condition of
the political and literary world by no means to his
mind, while that of the great body of the people was
becoming worse every day, he resisted all temptations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and started on the career which he followed faithfully
till his death. In 1802 appeared the first number of
“Cobbett’s Political Register,” which (with the break of
two months in 1817, when he fled from the new Gagging
Act to America) continued to appear weekly till June
1835, and remains a wonderful witness to the strength
and the weaknesses of the Sussex ploughboy. During
those long years, and all the fierce controversies which
marked them, he was grandly faithful, according to his
lights, to the cause of the poor:—“I for my part should
not be at all surprised,” he wrote in 1806, “if some one
were to propose selling the poor, or mortgaging them to
the fund-holders. Ah! you may wince; you may cry
Jacobin or leveller as long as you please. I wish to see
the poor men of England what the poor men of England
were when I was born; and from endeavoring to
accomplish this wish nothing but the want of means
shall make me desist.” And loyally he maintained the
fight against sinecures, place-hunting, and corruption of
all kinds until his death, full of years, the member for
Oldham, and the popular leader of the widest influence
among the Liberal party of the first Reform period.
For the incidents of the long struggle—how the government
press turned savagely on the man whom they
had hailed on his return from America as one “whom
no corruption can seduce nor any personal danger
intimidate from the performance of his duty;” how
Attorney-Generals watched him and prosecuted; how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he insisted on conducting his own causes, and so spent
two years in jail, and was mulcted again and again in
heavy damages; how he fought through it all, and tended
his farm and fruit-trees, and wrote his “Rural Rides”
and “Cottage Economy,” and was a tender and loving
man in his own home, and retained the warm regard of
such men as Wyndham and Lord Radnor, while he was
the best hated and abused man in England—we must
refer all (and we hope there are many) who care to know
about them to the second volume of Edward Smith’s
life of Cobbett.</p>

<p>There are few lives that we know of better worth
careful study in these times. We have no space here
to do more than quote the best estimate of the man’s
work which has ever come from one of those classes
who for thirty-five years looked on him as their most
dangerous enemy:—</p>

<h2>XCIV.</h2>


<p>The state of Europe thirty years ago was far more
dead and hopeless than now. There were no wars, certainly,
and no expectations of wars. But there was a
dull, beaten-down, pent-up feeling abroad, as if the lid
were screwed down on the nations, and the thing which
had been, however cruel and heavy and mean, was that
which was to remain to the end. England was better
off than her neighbors, but yet in bad case. In the
south and west particularly, several causes had combined
to spread a very bitter feeling abroad amongst
the agricultural poor. First among these stood the new
poor law, the provisions of which were rigorously carried
out in most districts. The poor had as yet felt the
harshness only of the new system. Then the land was
in many places in the hands of men on their last legs,
the old sporting farmers, who had begun business as
young men while the great war was going on, had made
money hand over hand for a few years out of the war
prices, and had tried to go on living with grayhounds
and yeomanry uniforms—“horse to ride and weapon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
wear”—through the hard years which had followed.
These were bad masters in every way, unthrifty, profligate,
needy, and narrow-minded. The younger men
who were supplanting them were introducing machinery,
threshing machines and winnowing machines, to take the
little bread which a poor man was still able to earn out
of the mouths of his wife and children—so at least the
poor thought and muttered to one another; and the
mutterings broke out every now and then in the long
nights of the winter months in blazing ricks and broken
machines. Game preserving was on the increase.
Australia and America had not yet become familiar
words in every English village, and the labor market
was everywhere overstocked; and last, but not least, the
corn laws were still in force, and the bitter and exasperating
strife in which they went out was at its height.
And while Swing and his myrmidons were abroad in the
counties, and could scarcely be kept down by yeomanry
and poor-law guardians, the great towns were in almost
worse case. Here too emigration had not yet set in to
thin the labor market; wages were falling, and prices
rising; the corn-law struggle was better understood and
far keener than in the country; and Chartism was gaining
force every day, and rising into a huge threatening
giant, waiting to put forth his strength, and eager for
the occasion which seemed at hand.</p>

<p>You generation of young men, who were too young
then to be troubled with such matters, and have grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
into manhood since, you little know—may you never
know!—what it is to be living the citizens of a divided
and distracted nation. For the time that danger is past.
In a happy hour, and so far as man can judge, in time,
and only just in time, came the repeal of the corn laws,
and the great cause of strife and the sense of injustice
passed away out of men’s minds. The nation was
roused by the Irish famine, and the fearful distress in
other parts of the country, to begin looking steadily
and seriously at some of the sores which were festering
in its body, and undermining health and life. And so
the tide had turned, and England had already passed
the critical point, when 1848 came upon Christendom,
and the whole of Europe leapt up into a wild blaze of
revolution.</p>

<p>Is any one still inclined to make light of the danger
that threatened England in that year, to sneer at the
10th of April, and the monster petition, and the monster
meetings on Kennington and other commons?
Well, if there be such persons amongst my readers, I
can only say that they can have known nothing of what
was going on around them and below them, at that time,
and I earnestly hope that their vision has become
clearer since then, and that they are not looking with
the same eyes that see nothing, at the signs of to-day.
For that there are questions still to be solved by us in
England, in this current half-century, quite as likely to
tear the nation in pieces as the corn laws, no man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
half an eye in his head can doubt. They may seem
little clouds like a man’s hand on the horizon just now,
but they will darken the whole heaven before long,
unless we can find wisdom enough amongst us to take
the little clouds in hand in time, and make them descend
in soft rain.</p>

<h2>XCV.</h2>


<p>The years 1848-9 had been years of revolution, and,
as always happens at such times, the minds of men had
been greatly stirred on many questions, and especially
on the problem of the social condition of the great
mass of the poor in all European countries. In Paris,
the revolution had been the signal for a great effort on
the part of the workmen; and some remarkable experiments
had been made, both by the Provisional Government
of 1848 and by certain employers of labor, and
bodies of skilled mechanics, with a view to place the
conditions of labor upon a more equitable and satisfactory
footing, or, to use the common phrase of the day,
to reconcile the interests of capital and labor. The
government experiment of “national workshops” had
failed disastrously, but a number of the private associations
were brilliantly successful. The history of some
of these associations—of the sacrifices which had been
joyfully made by the associates in order to collect the
small funds necessary to start them—of the ability and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
industry with which they were conducted, and of their
marvellous effect on the habits of all those engaged in
the work, had deeply interested many persons in England.
It was resolved to try an experiment of the same
kind in England, but the conditions were very different.
The seed there had already taken root amongst the
industrial classes, and the movement had come from
them. In England the workpeople, as a rule, had no
belief in association, except for defensive purposes. It
was chiefly amongst young professional men that the
idea was working, and it was necessary to preach it to
those whom it most concerned. Accordingly a society
was formed, chiefly of young barristers, under the presidency
of the late Mr. Maurice, who was then Chaplain
of Lincoln’s Inn, for the purpose of establishing associations
similar to those in Paris. It was called the
Society for Promoting Working Men’s Associations, and
I happened to be one of the original members, and on
the Council. We were all full of enthusiasm and hope
in our work, and of propagandist zeal: anxious to bring
in all the recruits we could. I cannot even now think
of my own state of mind at the time without wonder and
amusement. I certainly thought (and for that matter
have never altered my opinion to this day) that here we
had found the solution of the great labor question; but
I was also convinced that we had nothing to do but just
to announce it, and found an association or two, in
order to convert all England, and usher in the millennium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
at once, so plain did the whole thing seem to me.
I will not undertake to answer for the rest of the Council,
but I doubt whether I was at all more sanguine than
the majority. Consequently we went at it with a will:
held meetings at six o’clock in the morning (so as not
to interfere with our regular work) for settling the rules
of our central society, and its off-shoots, and late in the
evening, for gathering tailors, shoemakers, and other
handicraftsmen, whom we might set to work; started a
small publishing office, presided over by a diminutive
one-eyed costermonger, a rough-and-ready speaker and
poet (who had been in prison as a Chartist leader), from
which we issued tracts and pamphlets, and ultimately
a small newspaper; and, as the essential condition
of any satisfactory progress, commenced a vigorous
agitation for such an amendment in the law as would
enable our infant associations to carry on their business
in safety, and without hindrance. We very soon had
our hands full. Our denunciations of unlimited competition
brought on us attacks in newspapers and magazines,
which we answered, nothing loth. Our opponents
called us Utopians and Socialists, and we retorted that at
any rate we were Christians; that our trade principles
were on all-fours with Christianity, while theirs were
utterly opposed to it. So we got, or adopted, the name
of Christian Socialists, and gave it to our tracts, and our
paper. We were ready to fight our battle wherever we
found an opening, and got support from the most unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
quarters. I remember myself being asked to
meet Archbishop Whately, and several eminent political
economists, and explain what we were about. After
a couple of hours of hard discussion, in which I have no
doubt I talked much nonsense, I retired, beaten, but
quite unconvinced. Next day, the late Lord Ashburton,
who had been present, came to my chambers and gave
me a cheque for £50 to help our experiment; and a
few days later I found another nobleman, sitting on the
counter of our shoemakers’ association, arguing with the
manager, and giving an order for boots.</p>

<p>It was just in the midst of all this that my brother
came to live with us. I had already converted him, as
I thought. He was a subscribing member of our
Society, and dealt with our Associations; and I had no
doubt would now join the Council, and work actively
in the new crusade. I knew how sound his judgment
was, and that he never went back from a resolution once
taken, and therefore was all the more eager to make
sure of him, and, as a step in this direction, had already
placed his name on committees, and promised his
attendance. But I was doomed to disappointment.
He attended one or two of our meetings, but I could
not induce him to take any active part with us. At a
distance of more than twenty years it is of course difficult
to recall very accurately what passed between us,
but I can remember his reasons well enough to give the
substance of them. And first, as he had formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
objected to the violent language of the leaders of the
Anti-Corn-Law agitation, so he now objected to what
he looked upon as our extravagance.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to divide other people’s property?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Then why call yourselves Socialists?”</p>

<p>“But we couldn’t help ourselves: other people called
us so first.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you needn’t have accepted the name.
Why acknowledge that the cap fitted?”</p>

<p>“Well, it would have been cowardly to back out. We
borrow the ideas of these Frenchmen, of association as
opposed to competition as the true law of industry;
and of organizing labor—of securing the laborer’s
position by organizing production and consumption—and
it would be cowardly to shirk the name. It is only
fools who know nothing about the matter, or people
interested in the competitive system of trade, who
believe, or say, that a desire to divide other people’s
property is of the essence of Socialism.”</p>

<p>“That may be very true: but nine-tenths of mankind,
or at any rate, of Englishmen, come under one or the
other of those categories. If you are called Socialists,
you will never persuade the British public that this is
not your object. There was no need to take the name.
You have weight enough to carry already, without putting
that on your shoulders.”</p>

<p>This was his first objection, and he proved to be right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
At any rate, after some time we dropped the name, and
the “Christian Socialist” was changed into the “Journal
of Association.” English Socialists generally have instinctively
avoided it ever since, and called themselves
“co-operators,” thereby escaping much abuse in the
intervening years. And when I look back, I confess I
do not wonder that we repelled rather than attracted
men who, like my brother, were inclined theoretically to
agree with us. For I am bound to admit that a strong
vein of fanaticism and eccentricity ran through our
ranks, which the marvellous patience, gentleness, and
wisdom of our beloved president were not enough to
counteract or control. Several of our most active and
devoted members were also strong vegetarians, and
phonetists. In a generation when beards and wide-awakes
were looked upon as insults to decent society,
some of us wore both, with a most heroic indifference to
public opinion. In the same way, there was often a
trenchant, and almost truculent, tone about us, which
was well calculated to keep men of my brother’s temperament
at a distance. I rather enjoyed it myself, but
learnt its unwisdom when I saw its effects on him, and
others, who were inclined to join us, and would have
proved towers of strength. It was right and necessary
to denounce the evils of unlimited competition, and the
falsehood of the economic doctrine of “every man for
himself;” but quite unnecessary, and therefore unwise,
to speak of the whole system of trade as “the disgusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
vice of shop-keeping,” as was the habit of several of
our foremost and ablest members.</p>

<p>Hardy had a way of throwing life into what he was
talking about, and, like many men with strong opinions,
and passionate natures, either carried his hearers off
their legs and away with him altogether, or roused every
spark of combativeness in them. The latter was the
effect which his lecture on the Punic Wars had on
Tom. He made several protests as Hardy went on;
but Grey’s anxious looks kept him from going fairly into
action, till Hardy stuck the black pin, which represented
Scipio, triumphantly in the middle of Carthage, and,
turning round said, “And now for some tea, Grey, before
you have to turn out.”</p>

<p>Tom opened fire while the tea was brewing.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t say anything bad enough about aristocracies
this morning, Hardy, and now to-night you are
crowing over the success of the heaviest and cruelest
oligarchy that ever lived, and praising them up to the
skies.”</p>

<p>“Hullo! here’s a breeze!” said Hardy, smiling;
“but I rejoice, O Brown, in that they thrashed the
Carthaginians, and not, as you seem to think, in that
they, being aristocrats, thrashed the Carthaginians; for
oligarchs they were not at this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“At any rate they answer to the Spartans in the
struggle, and the Carthaginians to the Athenians; and
yet all your sympathies are with the Romans to-night in
the Punic Wars, though they were with the Athenians
before dinner.”</p>

<p>“I deny your position. The Carthaginians were
nothing but a great trading aristocracy—with a glorious
family or two I grant you, like that of Hannibal; but, on
the whole, a dirty, bargain-driving, buy-cheap-and-sell-dear
aristocracy—of whom the world was well rid.
They like the Athenians indeed! Why, just look what
the two people have left behind them——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Tom; “but we only know the
Carthaginians through the reports of their destroyers.
Your heroes trampled them out with hoofs of iron.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the Roman hoof could have trampled
out their Homer if they ever had one?” said Hardy.
“The Romans conquered Greece too, remember.”</p>

<p>“But Greece was never so near beating them.”</p>

<p>“True. But I hold to my point. Carthage was the
mother of all hucksters, compassing sea and land to
sell her wares.”</p>

<p>“And no bad line of life for a nation. At least Englishmen
ought to think so.”</p>

<p>“No, they ought not; at least if ‘Punica fides’ is to
be the rule of trade. Selling any amount of Brummagem
wares never did nation or man much good, and
never will. Eh, Grey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Grey winced at being appealed to, but remarked that
he hoped the Church would yet be able to save England
from the fate of Tyre and Carthage, the great trading
nations of the old world: and then, swallowing his tea,
and looking as if he had been caught robbing a hen-roost,
he made a sudden exit, and hurried away out of
college to the night-school.</p>

<p>“What a pity he is so odd and shy,” said Tom; “I
should so like to know more of him.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a pity. He is much better when he is alone
with me. I think he has heard from some of the set
that you are a furious Protestant, and sees an immense
amount of stiff-neckedness in you.”</p>

<p>“But about England and Carthage,” said Tom, shirking
the subject of his own peculiarities; “you don’t
really think us like them? It gave me a turn to hear
you translating ‘Punica fides’ into Brummagem wares
just now.”</p>

<p>“I think that successful trade is our rock ahead.
The devil who holds new markets and twenty per cent.
profits in his gift is the devil that England has most to
fear from. ‘Because of unrighteous dealings, and riches
gotten by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one
people to another,’ said the wise man. Grey falls back
on the Church, you see, to save the nation; but the
Church he dreams of will never do it. Is there any
that can? There <i>must</i> be surely, or we have believed a
lie. But this work of making trade righteous, of Christianizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
trade, looks like the very hardest the Gospel
has ever had to take in hand—in England at any
rate.”</p>

<p>Hardy spoke slowly and doubtfully, and paused as if
asking for Tom’s opinion.</p>

<p>“I never heard it put in that way. I know very little
of politics or the state of England. But come, now;
the putting down the slave-trade and compensating our
planters, <i>that</i> shows that we are not sold to the trade-devil
yet, surely.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we are. No, thank God, there are
plenty of signs that we are likely to make a good fight
of it yet.”</p>

<p>The newest school of philosophy preaches an “organized
religion,” an hierarchy of the best and ablest. In
an inarticulate way the confession rises from the masses
that they feel on every side of them the need of wise
and strong government—of a will to which their will
may loyally submit—before all other needs; have been
groping blindly after it this long while; begin to know
that their daily life is in daily peril for want of it, in a
country of limited land, air, and water, and practically
unlimited wealth. But Democracy—how about Democracy?
We had thought a cry for it, and not for kings,
God made or of any other kind, was the characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of our time. Certainly kings, such as we have seen them,
have not gained or deserved much reverence of late
years, are not likely to be called for with any great
earnestness by those who feel most need of guidance
and deliverance, in the midst of the bewildering conditions
and surroundings of our time and our life.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago the framework of society went all
to pieces over the greater part of Christendom, and the
kings just ran away or abdicated, and the people, left
pretty much to themselves, in some places made blind
work of it. Solvent and well-regulated society caught
a glimpse of that same “big black democracy,”—the
monster, the Frankenstein, as they hold him, at any
rate the great undeniable fact of our time—a glimpse
of him moving his huge limbs about, uneasily and
blindly. Then, mainly by the help of broken pledges
and bayonets, the so-called kings managed to get the
gyves put on him again, and to shut him down in his
underground prison. That was the sum of their work
in the great European crisis; not a thankworthy one
from the people’s point of view. However, society was
supposed to be saved, and the “party of order,” so
called, breathed freely. No; for the 1848 kind of king
there is surely no audible demand anywhere. In England
in that year we had our 10th of April, and muster
of half a million special constables of the comfortable
classes, with much jubilation over such muster, and
mutual congratulations that we were not as other men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
or even as these Frenchmen, Germans, and the like.
Taken for what it was worth, let us admit that the jubilations
did not lack some sort of justification. The
10th of April muster may be perhaps accepted as a sign
that the reverence for the constable’s staff has not quite
died out amongst us. But let no one think that for this
reason democracy is one whit less inevitable in England
than on the Continent, or that its sure and steady
advance, and the longing for its coming, which all
thoughtful men recognize, however little they may sympathize,
with them, in the least incompatible with the
equally manifest longing for what our people intend by
this much-worshipped and much-hated name.</p>

<p>For what does democracy mean to Englishmen?
Simply an equal chance for all; a fair field for the best
men, let them start from where they will, to get to the
front; a clearance out of sham governors, and of unjust
privilege, in every department of human affairs. It
cannot be too often repeated, that they who suppose
the bulk of our people want less government, or fear
the man who “can rule and dare not lie,” know little
of them. Ask any representative of a popular constituency,
or other man with the means of judging, what
the people are ready for in this direction. He will tell
you that, in spite perhaps of all he can say or do, they
<i>will</i> go for compulsory education, the organization of
labor (including therein the sharp extinction of able-bodied
pauperism), the utilization of public lands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
other reforms of an equally decided character. That
for these purposes they desire more government, not
less; will support with enthusiasm measures, the very
thought of which takes away the breath and loosens the
knees of ordinary politicians; will rally with loyalty and
trustfulness to men who will undertake these things
with courage and singleness of purpose.</p>

<p>The corners of Hardy’s room were covered with
sheets of paper of different sizes, pasted against the wall
in groups. In the line of sight, from about the height
of four to six feet, there was scarcely an inch of the
original paper visible, and round each centre group there
were outlying patches and streamers, stretching towards
floor or ceiling, or away nearly to the bookcases or fireplace.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think it a great improvement on the
old paper?” said Hardy. “I shall be out of rooms
next term, and it will be a hint to the College that the
rooms want papering. You’re no judge of such matters,
or I should ask you whether you don’t see great artistic
taste in the arrangement.”</p>

<p>“Why, they’re nothing but maps, and lists of names
and dates,” said Tom, who had got up to examine the
decorations. “And what in the world are all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
queer pins for?” he went on, pulling a strong pin with
a large red sealing-wax head out of the map nearest to
him.</p>

<p>“Hullo! take care there; what are you about?”
shouted Hardy, getting up and hastening to the corner.
“Why, you irreverent beggar, those pins are the famous
statesmen and warriors of Greece and Rome.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn’t know I was in such
august company;” saying which, Tom proceeded to
stick the red-headed pin back into the wall.</p>

<p>“Now, just look at that,” said Hardy, taking the pin
out from the place where Tom had stuck it. “Pretty
doings there would be amongst them with your management.
This pin is Brasidas; you’ve taken him away
from Naupactus, where he was watching the eleven
Athenian galleys anchored under the temple of Apollo,
and stuck him down right in the middle of the Pnyx,
where he will be instantly torn in pieces by a ruthless
and reckless mob. You call yourself a Tory indeed!
However, ’twas always the same with you Tories; calculating,
cruel, and jealous. Use your leaders up, and
throw them over—that’s the golden rule of aristocracies.”</p>

<p>“Hang Brasidas,” said Tom, laughing; “stick him
back at Naupactus again. Here, which is Cleon? The
scoundrel! give me hold of him, and I’ll put him in a
hot berth.”</p>

<p>“That’s he, with the yellow head. Let him alone, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
tell you, or all will be hopeless confusion when Grey
comes for his lecture. We’re only in the third year of
the war.”</p>

<p>“I like your chaff about Tories sacrificing their great
men,” said Tom, putting his hands in his pockets to
avoid temptation. “How about your precious democracy,
old fellow? Which is Socrates?”</p>

<p>“Here, the dear old boy!—this pin with the great
gray head, in the middle of Athens, you see. I pride
myself on my Athens. Here’s the Piræus and the long
walls, and the hill of Mars. Isn’t it as good as a
picture?”</p>

<p>“Well, it <i>is</i> better than most maps, I think,” said
Tom; “but you’re not going to slip out so easily. I
want to know whether your pet democracy did or did
not murder Socrates.”</p>

<p>“I’m not bound to defend democracies. But look at
my pins. It may be the natural fondness of a parent,
but I declare they seem to me to have a great deal of
character, considering the material. You’ll guess them
at once, I’m sure, if you mark the color and shape of
the wax. This one now, for instance, who is he?”</p>

<p>“Alcibiades,” answered Tom, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Alcibiades!” shouted Hardy; “you fresh from
Rugby, and not know your Thucydides better than that.
There’s Alcibiades, that little purple-headed, foppish
pin, by Socrates. This rusty colored one is that respectable
old stick-in-the-mud, Nicias.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, but you’ve made Alcibiades nearly the smallest
of the whole lot,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“So he was, to my mind,” said Hardy; “just the
sort of insolent young ruffian whom I should have liked
to buy at my price, and sell at his own. He must have
been very like some of our gentlemen-commoners, with
the addition of brains.”</p>

<p>“I should really think, though,” said Tom, “it must
be a capital plan for making you remember the history.”</p>

<p>“It is, I flatter myself. I’ve long had the idea, but I
should never have worked it out and found the value of
it but for Grey. I invented it to coach him in his history.
You see we are in the Grecian corner. Over
there is the Roman. You’ll find Livy and Tacitus
worked out there, just as Herodotus and Thucydides are
here; and the pins are stuck for the Second Punic
War, where we are just now. I shouldn’t wonder if Grey
got his first, after all, he’s picking up so quick in my
corners; and says he never forgets any set of events
when he has pricked them out with the pins.”</p>

<h2>XCIX.</h2>


<p>The Reformation had to do its work in due course, in
temporal as well as in spiritual things, in the visible as in
the invisible world; for the Stuart princes asserted in
temporal matters the powers which the Pope had claimed
in spiritual. They, too, would acknowledge the sanctity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of no law above the will of princes—would vindicate,
even with the sword and scaffold, their own powers
to dispense with laws. So the second great revolt of
the English nation came, against all visible earthly sovereignty
in things temporal. Puritanism arose, and
Charles went to the block, and the proclamation went
forth that henceforth the nation would have no king but
Christ; that he was the only possible king for the English
nation from that time forth, in temporal as well as
spiritual things, and that his kingdom had actually
come. The national conscience was not with the Puritans
as it had been with Henry at the time of the Reformation,
but the deepest part of their protest has held
its own, and gained strength ever since, from their day
to ours. The religious source and origin of it was, no
doubt, thrust aside at the Revolution, but the sagacious
statesmen of 1688 were as clear as the soldiers of Ireton
and Ludlow in their resolve, that no human will
should override the laws and customs of the realm. So
they, too, required of their sovereigns that they should
“solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of
this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto belonging,
according to the statutes in Parliament agreed
on, and the laws and customs of the same; ...
that they will to the utmost of their power maintain the
laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the
Protestant reformed religion established by law.” The
same protest in a far different form came forth again at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the great crisis at the end of the eighteenth century,
when the revolutionary literature of France had set
Europe in a blaze, and the idea of the rights of man
had shrunk back, and merged in the will of the mob.
Against this assertion of this form of self-will again the
English nation took resolute ground. They had striven
for a law which was above popes and kings, to which
these must conform on pain of suppression. They
strove for it now against mob-law, against popular will,
openly avowing its own omnipotence, and making the
tyrant’s claim to do what was right in its own eyes.
And so through our whole history the same thread has
run. The nation, often confusedly and with stammering
accents, but still on the whole consistently, has
borne the same witness as the Church, that as God is
living and reigning there must be a law, the expression
of his will, at the foundation of all human society, which
priests, kings, rulers, people must discover, acknowledge,
obey.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>C.</h2>


<p>Christians may acknowledge that, as a rule, and in
the long run, the decision of a country, fairly taken, is
likely to be right, and that the will of the people is
likely to be more just and patient than that of any person
or class. No one can honestly look at the history
of our race in the last quarter of a century, to go no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
farther back, and not gladly admit the weight of evidence
in favor of this view. There is no great question
of principle which has arisen in politics here, in which
the great mass of the nation has not been from the first
on that which has been at last acknowledged as the
right side. In America, to take one great example, the
attitude of the Northern people from first to last, in the
great civil war, will make proud the hearts of English-speaking
men as long as their language lasts.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CI.</h2>


<p>The real public opinion of a nation, expressing its
deepest conviction (as distinguished from what is ordinarily
called public opinion, the first cry of professional
politicians and journalists, which usually goes wrong,)
is undoubtedly entitled to very great respect. But
after making all fair allowances, no honest man, however
warm a democrat he may be, can shut his eyes to
the facts which stare him in the face at home, in our
colonies, in the United States, and refuse to acknowledge
that the will of the majority in a nation, ascertained
by the best processes yet known to us, is not always or
altogether just, or consistent, or stable; that the deliberate
decisions of the people are not unfrequently
tainted by ignorance, or passion, or prejudice.</p>

<p>Are we, then, to rest contented with this ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
regal power, to resign ourselves to the inevitable, and
admit that for us, here at last in this nineteenth century,
there is nothing higher or better to look for; and if we
are to have a king at all, it must be king people or king
mob, according to the mood in which our section of
collective humanity happens to be? Surely we are not
prepared for this any more than the Pope is. Many of
us feel that Tudors, and Stuarts, and Oliver Cromwell,
and cliques of Whig or Tory aristocrats, may have been
bad enough; but that any tyranny under which England
has groaned in the past has been light by the side of
what we may come to, if we are to carry out the new
political gospel to its logical conclusion, and surrender
ourselves to government by the counting of heads,
pure and simple.</p>

<p>But if we will not do this is there any alternative,
since we repudiate personal government, but to fall back
on the old Hebrew and Christian faith, that the nations
are ruled by a living, present, invisible King, whose will
is perfectly righteous and loving, the same yesterday,
to-day, and forever? It is beside the question to urge
that such a faith throws us back on an invisible power,
and that we must have visible rulers. Of course we
must have visible rulers, even after the advent of the
“confederate social republic of Europe.” When the
whole people is king it must have viceroys like other
monarchs. But is public opinion visible? Can we see
“collective humanity?” Is it easier for princes or statesmen—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
any man or men upon whose shoulders the
government rests—to ascertain the will of the people
than the will of God? Another consideration meets us
at once, and that is, that this belief is assumed in our
present practice. Not to insist upon the daily usage in
all Christian places of worship and families throughout
the land, the Parliament of the country opens its daily
sittings with the most direct confession of this faith
which words can express, and prays—addressing God,
and not public opinion, or collective humanity—“Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done.” Surely it were better
to get rid of this solemn usage as a piece of cant, which
must demoralize the representatives of the nation, if we
mean nothing particular by it, and either recast our form
of prayer, substituting “the people,” or what else we
please, for “God,” or let the whole business alone, as
one which passes man’s understanding. If we really
believe that a nation has no means of finding out God’s
will, it is hypocritical and cowardly to go on praying
that it may be done.</p>

<p>But it will be said, assuming all that is asked, what
practical difference can it possibly make in the government
of nations? Admit as pointedly as you can, by
profession and by worship, and honestly believe, that a
Divine will is ruling in the world, and in each nation,
what will it effect? Will it alter the course of events one
iota, or the acts of any government or governor.
Would not a Neapolitan Bourbon be just as ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
make it his watchword as any English Alfred! Might
not a committee of public safety placard the scaffold
with a declaration of this faith? It is a contention for
a shadow.</p>

<p>Is it so? Does not every man recognize in his own
life, and in his own observation of the world around
him, the enormous and radical difference between the
two principles of action and the results which they
bring about? What man do we reckon worthy of honor,
and delight to obey and follow—him who asks, when
he has to act, what will A, B, and C say to this? or him
who asks, is this right, true, just, in harmony with the
will of God. Don’t we despise ourselves when we give
way to the former tendency, or in other words, when we
admit the sovereignty of public opinion? Don’t we feel
that we are in the right and manly path when we follow
the latter? And if this be true of private men, it must
hold in the case of those who are in authority.</p>

<p>Those rulers, whatever name they may go by, who
turn to what constituents, leagues, the press are saying
or doing, to guide them as to the course they are to
follow, in the faith that the will of the majority is the
ultimate and only possible arbiter, will never deliver or
strengthen a nation however skilful they may be in
occupying its best places.</p>

<h2>CII.</h2>


<p>All the signs of our time tell us that the day of
earthly kings has gone by, and the advent to power of
the great body of the people, those who live by manual
labor, is at hand. Already a considerable percentage
of them are as intelligent and provident as the classes
above them, and as capable of conducting affairs, and
administering large interests successfully. In England,
the co-operative movement and the organization of
the trade societies should be enough to prove this, to
any one who has eyes, and is open to conviction. In another
generation that number will have increased tenfold,
and the sovereignty of the country will virtually
pass into their hands. Upon their patriotism and good
sense the fortunes of the kingdom will depend as
directly and absolutely as they have ever depended on
the will of earthly king or statesman. It is vain to
blink the fact that democracy is upon us, that “new
order of society which is to be founded by labor for
labor,” and the only thing for wise men to do is to look
it in the face, and see how the short intervening years
may be used to the best advantage. Happily for us,
the task has been already begun in earnest. Our
soundest and wisest political thinkers are all engaged
upon the great and inevitable change, whether they
dread, or exult in the prospect. Thus far, too, they all
agree that the great danger of the future lies in that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
readiness of the people to act in great masses, and to
get rid of personal and individual responsibility, which
is the characteristic of the organizations by which they
have gained, and secured, their present position. Nor
is there any danger as to how this danger is to be met.
Our first aim must be to develop to the utmost the sense
of personal and individual responsibility.</p>

<p>But how is this to be done? To whom are men
wielding great powers to be taught that they are responsible?
If they can learn that there is still a King
ruling in England through them, whom if they will fear
they need fear no other power in earth or heaven, whom
if they can love and trust they will want no other guide
or helper, all will be well, and we may look for a reign
of justice in England such as she has never seen yet,
whatever form our government may take. But, in any
case, those who hold the old faith will still be sure that
the order of God’s kingdom will not change. If the
kings of the earth are passing away, because they have
never acknowledged the order which was established for
them, the conditions on which they were set in high
places, those who succeed them will have to come under
the same order, and the same conditions. When the
great body of those who have done the hard work of
the world, and got little enough of its wages hitherto—the
real stuff of which every nation is composed—have
entered on their inheritance, they may sweep away many
things, and make short work with thrones and kings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
But there is one throne which they cannot pull down—the
throne of righteousness, which is over all the
nations; and one King whose rule they cannot throw off—the
Son of God and Son of Man, who will judge
them as he has judged all kings and all governments
before them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CIII.</h2>


<p>Kings, priests, judges, whatever men succeed to, or
usurp, or are thrust into power, come immediately under
that eternal government which the God of the nation
has established, and the order of which cannot be violated
with impunity. Every ruler who ignores or defies
it saps the national life and prosperity, and brings
trouble on his country, sometimes swiftly, but always
surely. There is the perpetual presence of a King, with
whom rulers and people must come to a reckoning in
every national crisis and convulsion, and who is no less
present when the course of affairs is quiet and prosperous.
The greatest and wisest men of the nation are
those in whom this faith burns most strongly. Elijah’s
solemn opening, “As the Lord liveth, before whom I
stand;” David’s pleading, “Whither shall I go from
thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy presence?”—his
confession that in heaven or hell, or the
uttermost parts of the sea, “there also shall thy
hand lead, and thy right hand shall guide me”—are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
only well-known instances of a universal consciousness
which never wholly leaves men or nations, however
much they may struggle to get rid of it.</p>

<p>“Who is that who has just come in, in beaver?” said
Tom, touching the next man to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you know? That’s Blake; he’s the most
wonderful fellow in Oxford,” answered his neighbor.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Why, he can do everything better than almost anybody,
and without any trouble at all. Miller was obliged
to have him in the boat last year though he never
trained a bit. Then he’s in the eleven, and is a wonderful
rider, and tennis-player, and shot.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and he’s so awfully clever with it all,” joined
in the man on the other side. “He’ll be a safe first,
though I don’t believe he reads more than you or I.
He can write songs, too, as fast as you can talk nearly,
and sings them wonderfully.”</p>

<p>“Is he of our College, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, or he couldn’t have been in our boat
last year.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think I ever saw him in chapel or hall.”</p>

<p>“No, I dare say not. He hardly ever goes to either,
and yet he manages never to get hauled up much, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
one knows how. He never gets up now till the afternoon,
and sits up nearly all night playing cards with the
fastest fellows, or going round singing glees at three or
four in the morning.”</p>

<p>Tom looked with great interest at the admirable
Crichton of St. Ambrose’s; and, after watching him a
few minutes, said in a low tone to his neighbor:</p>

<p>“How wretched he looks! I never saw a sadder
face.”</p>

<p>Poor Blake! one can’t help calling him “poor,”
although he himself would have winced at it more than
at any other name you could have called him. You
might have admired, feared, or wondered at him, and he
would have been pleased; the object of his life was to
raise such feelings in his neighbors; but pity was the
last which he would have liked to excite.</p>

<p>He was indeed a wonderfully gifted fellow, full of all
sorts of energy and talent, and power and tenderness;
and yet, as his face told only too truly to any one who
watched him when he was exerting himself in society,
one of the most wretched men in the College. He had
a passion for success—for beating everybody else in
whatever he took in hand, and that, too, without seeming
to make any great effort himself. The doing a
thing well and thoroughly gave him no satisfaction
unless he could feel that he was doing it better and
more easily than A, B, or C, and that they felt and acknowledged
this. He had had his full swing of success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
for two years, and now the Nemesis was coming.</p>

<p>For, although not an extravagant man, many of the
pursuits in which he had eclipsed all rivals were far beyond
the means of any but a rich one, and Blake was
not rich. He had a fair allowance, but by the end of
his first year was considerably in debt, and, at the time
we are speaking of, the whole pack of Oxford tradesmen,
into whose books he had got (having smelt out the
leanness of his expectations), were upon him, besieging
him for payment. This miserable and constant annoyance
was wearing his soul out. This was the reason
why his oak was sported, and he was never seen till
the afternoons, and turned night into day. He was too
proud to come to an understanding with his persecutors,
even had it been possible; and now, at his sorest need,
his whole scheme of life was failing him; his love of
success was turning into ashes in his mouth; he felt
much more disgust than pleasure at his triumphs over
other men, and yet the habit of striving for such successes,
notwithstanding its irksomeness, was too strong
to be resisted.</p>

<p>Poor Blake! he was living on from hand to mouth,
flashing out with all his old brilliancy and power, and
forcing himself to take the lead in whatever company
he might be; but utterly lonely and depressed when by
himself—reading feverishly in secret, in a desperate
effort to retrieve all by high honors and a fellowship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
As Tom said to his neighbors, there was no sadder face
than his to be seen in Oxford.</p>

<p>One of the moralists whom we sat under in my youth—was

These consequences, I for one am ready to encounter.
I pity people who weren’t found in a vale. I don’t

bounded by hills. The having your hill <i>always</i> in view

which we have to undergo once, at least, in every spring.
As each succeeding winter wears away, the same thing
happens to us.</p>

<p>For some time we do not trust the fair lengthening
days, and cannot believe that the dirty pair of sparrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
who live opposite our window are really making love and
going to build, notwithstanding all their twittering.
But morning after morning rises fresh and gentle; there
is no longer any vice in the air; we drop our overcoats;
we rejoice in the green shoots which the privet-hedge
is making in the square garden, and hail the returning
tender-pointed leaves of the plane-trees as
friends; we go out of our way to walk through Covent
Garden Market to see the ever-brightening show of
flowers from the happy country.</p>

<p>This state of things goes on sometimes for a few days
only, sometimes for weeks, till we make sure that we
are safe for this spring at any rate. Don’t we wish we
may get it! Sooner or later, but sure—sure as Christmas
bills, or the income-tax, or anything, if there be
anything surer than these—comes the morning when
we are suddenly conscious as soon as we rise that there
is something the matter. We do not feel comfortable
in our clothes; nothing tastes quite as it should at
breakfast; though the day looks bright enough, there is
a fierce dusty taint about it as we look out through windows,
which no instinct now prompts us to throw open,
as it has done every day for the last month.</p>

<p>But it is only when we open our doors and issue into
the street, that the hateful reality comes right home to
us. All moisture, and softness, and pleasantness has
gone clean out of the air since last night; we seem to
inhale yards of horsehair instead of satin; our skins dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
up; our eyes, and hair, and whiskers, and clothes are
soon filled with loathsome dust, and our nostrils with
the reek of the great city. We glance at the weathercock
on the nearest steeple, and see that it points N.E.
And so long as the change lasts, we carry about with us
a feeling of anger and impatience as though we personally
were being ill-treated. We could have borne with
it well enough in November; it would have been
natural, and all in the day’s work in March; but now,
when Rotten-row is beginning to be crowded, when long
lines of pleasure-vans are leaving town on Monday
mornings for Hampton Court or the poor remains of
dear Epping Forrest, when the exhibitions are open or
about to open, when the religious public is up, or on its
way up, for May meetings, when the Thames is already
sending up faint warnings of what we may expect as
soon as his dirty old life’s blood shall have been
thoroughly warmed up, and the Ship, and Trafalgar, and
Star and Garter are in full swing at the antagonist poles
of the cockney system, we do feel that this blight which
has come over us and everything is an insult, and that
while it lasts, as there is nobody who can be made particularly
responsible for it, we are justified in going
about in general disgust, and ready to quarrel with anybody
we may meet on the smallest pretext.</p>

<p>This sort of east-windy state is perhaps the best
physical analogy for certain mental ones through which
most of us pass. The real crisis over, we drift into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
skirts of the storm, and lay rolling under bare poles,
comparatively safe, but without any power as yet to get
the ship well in hand, and make her obey her helm.
The storm may break over us again at any minute, and
find us almost as helpless as ever.</p>

<p>Amongst other distractions which Tom tried at one
crisis of his life, was reading. For three or four days
running, he really worked hard—very hard, if we were
to reckon by the number of hours he spent in his own
rooms over his books with his oak sported—hard, even
though we should only reckon by results. For, though
scarcely an hour passed that he was not balancing on
the hind legs of his chair with a vacant look in his eyes,
and thinking of anything but Greek roots or Latin
constructions, yet on the whole he managed to get
through a good deal, and one evening, for the first time
since his quarrel with Hardy, felt a sensation of real
comfort—it hardly amounted to pleasure—as he closed
his Sophocles some hour or so after hall, having just
finished the last of the Greek plays which he meant to
take in for his first examination. He leaned back in
his chair and sat for a few minutes, letting his thoughts
follow their own bent. They soon took to going wrong,
and he jumped up in fear lest he should be drifting back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
into the black stormy sea, in the trough of which he had
been laboring so lately, and which he felt he was by no
means clear of yet. At first he caught up his cap and
gown as though he were going out. There was a wine
party at one of his acquaintance’s rooms; or, he could
go and smoke a cigar in the pool-room, or at any one of
the dozen other places. On second thoughts, however,
he threw his academicals back on to the sofa, and went
to his bookcase. The reading had paid so well that
evening that he resolved to go on with it. He had no
particular object in selecting one book more than
another, and so took down carelessly the first that came
to hand.</p>

<p>It happened to be a volume of Plato, and opened of
its own accord in the “Apology.” He glanced at a
few lines. What a flood of memories they called up!
This was almost the last book he had read at school;
and teacher, and friends, and lofty oak-shelved library
stood out before him at once. Then the blunders that
he himself and others had made rushed through his
mind, and he almost burst into a laugh as he wheeled
his chair round to the window, and began reading where
he had opened, encouraging every thought of the old
times when he first read that marvellous defence, and
throwing himself back into them with all his might.
And still, as he read, forgotten words of wise comment,
and strange thoughts of wonder and longing, came back
to him. The great truth which he had been led to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
brink of in those early days rose in all its awe and all
its attractiveness before him. He leant back in his
chair, and gave himself up to his thought; and how
strangely that thought bore on the struggle which had
been raging in him of late; how an answer seemed to
be trembling to come out of it to all the cries, now
defiant, now plaintive, which had gone out of his heart
in this time of trouble! For his thought was of that
spirit, distinct from himself, and yet communing with his
inmost soul, always dwelling in him, knowing him better
than he knew himself, never misleading him, always
leading him to light and truth, of which the old philosopher
spoke. “The old heathen, Socrates, did actually
believe that—there can be no question about it;” he
thought, “Has not the testimony of the best men
through these two thousand years borne witness that he
was right—that he did not believe a lie! That was
what we were told. Surely I don’t mistake! Were we
not told, too, or did I dream it, that what was true for
him is true for every man—for me? That there is a
spirit dwelling in me, striving with me, ready to lead me
into all truth if I will submit to his guidance?</p>

<p>“Ah! submit, submit, there’s the rub! Give yourself
up to his guidance! Throw up the reins, and say you’ve
made a mess of it. Well, why not? Haven’t I made
a mess of it? Am I fit to hold the reins?</p>

<p>“Not I,”—he got up and began walking about his
rooms—“I give it up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give it up!” he went on presently; “yes, but to
whom? Not to the dæmon, spirit, whatever it was,
who took up his abode in the old Athenian—at least,
so he said, and so I believe. No, no! Two thousand
years and all that they have seen have not passed over
the world to leave us just where he was left. We want
no dæmons or spirits. And yet the old heathen was
guided right, and what can a man want more? and
who ever wanted guidance more than I now—here—in
this room—at this minute? I give up the reins;
who will take them?” And so there came on him one of
those seasons when a man’s thoughts cannot be followed
in words. A sense of awe came upon him, and over
him, and wrapped him round; awe at a presence of
which he was becoming suddenly conscious, into which
he seemed to have wandered, and yet which he felt must
have been there, around him, in his own heart and soul,
though he knew it not. There was hope and longing in
his heart mingling with the fear of that presence, but
withal the old reckless and daring feeling which he knew
so well, still bubbling up untamed, untamable it seemed
to him.</p>

<p>Men and women occupied with the common work of
life—who are earning their bread in the sweat of their
brows, and marrying, and bringing up children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
struggling, and sinning, and repenting—feel that certain
questions which school-men are discussing are somehow
their questions. Not indeed in form, for not one
in a thousand of the persons whose minds are thus disturbed
care to make themselves acquainted with the
forms and modes of theological controversies. If they
try to do so, they soon throw them aside with impatience.
They feel, “No, it is not this. We care not what may
be said about ideology, or multitudinism, or evidential
views, or cogenogonies. At the bottom of all this we
suspect—nay, we know—there is a deeper strife, a
strife about the very foundations of faith and human
life. We want to know from you learned persons,
whether (as we have been told from our infancy) there
is a faith for mankind, for us as well as for you, for the
millions of our own countrymen, and in all Christian
and heathen lands, who find living their lives a sore
business, and have need of all the light they can get to
help them.”</p>

<p>It cannot be denied. The sooner we face the fact,
the better. This is the question, and it has to be answered
now, by us living Englishmen and Englishwomen;
the deepest question which man has to do
with, and yet—or rather, therefore—one which every
toiling man must grapple with, for the sake of his own
honesty, of his own life.</p>

<p>For many years I have been thrown very much
into the society of young men of all ranks. I spend a
great part of my time with them, I like being with them,
and I think they like being with me. I know well, therefore,
how rare anything like a living faith—a faith in
and by which you can live, and for which you would
die—is amongst them. I know that it is becoming
rarer every day. I find it every day more difficult to get
them to speak on the subject: they will not do so unless
you drive them to it.</p>

<p>I feel deeply that for the sake of England they must
be driven to it, and therefore that it is the bounden duty
of every man who has any faith himself, and who has a
chance of being listened to by them, to speak out manfully
what he has to say, concealing nothing, disguising
nothing, and leaving the issue to God.</p>

<p>That which has been called the “negative theology,”
has been spreading rapidly these last few years, though
for the most part silently. In the first instance it may
have been simply “a recoil from some of the doctrines
which are to be heard at church and chapel; a distrust
of the old arguments for, or proofs of, a miraculous revelation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and a misgiving as to the authority, or extent
of the authority of the Scriptures.” But as was sure to
be the case, the “negative theology” could not stop, and
has not stopped here. Men who have come across these
recoils, distrusts, misgivings, will soon find, if they are
honest and resolute with themselves, that there is another
doubt underlying all these, a doubt which they
may turn from in horror when it is first whispered in
their hearts, but which will come back again and again.
That doubt is whether there is a God at all, or rather,
whether a living, personal God, thinking, acting, and
ruling in this world in which we are, has ever revealed
Himself to man.</p>

<p>This is the one question of our time, and of all
times; upon the answer which nations or men can give
to it hang life and death.... One cannot stand
upon a simple negation. The world is going on turning
as it used to do, night succeeding day and generation
generation; nations are waking into life, or falling
into bondage; there is a deal of wonderful work of one
sort or another going on in it, and you and I in our little
corner have our own share of work to get done as well
as we can. If you put out my old light, some light or
other I must have, and you would wish me to have.
What is it to be?</p>

<p>You will answer, probably, that I have touched the
heart of the matter in putting my question. Night follows
day, and generation, generation. All things are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
founded on a “permanent order,” “self-sustaining and
self-evolving powers pervade all nature.” Of this order
and these powers we are getting to know more every
day; when we know them perfectly, man, the colossal
man, will have reached the highest development of
which he is capable. We need not trouble ourselves
about breaking them, or submitting to them; some of
you would add, for we cannot either break them or submit
to them. They will fulfil themselves. It is they,
these great generalizations, which are alone acting in,
and ruling the world. We, however eccentric our
actions may be, however we may pride ourselves on
willing and working, are only simple links in the chain.
A general <i>law of average</i> orders the unruly wills and affections
of sinful men.</p>

<p>But here I must ask, on what is this permanent order,
on what are these laws which you tell me of, founded?
I acknowledge a permanent order, physical laws, as
fully as you can, but believe them to be expressions
of a living and a righteous will; I believe a holy and
true God to be behind them, therefore I can sit down
humbly, and try to understand them, and when I understand,
to obey. Are the permanent order, the laws you
speak of, founded on a will? If so, on whose will? If
on the will of <i>a</i> God, of what God? Of a God who has
revealed His character, His purpose, Himself, to you?
If so, where, how, when?</p>

<p>But if you tell me that these laws, this order, are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
founded on any living will, or that you do not know
that they are, then I say you are holding out to me “an
iron rule which guides to nothing and ends in nothing—which
may be possible to the logical understanding,
but is not possible to the spirit of man”—and you are
telling me, since worship is a necessity of my being, to
worship that. In the name and in the strength of a
man, and a man’s will I utterly reject and defy your
dead laws, for dead they must be. They may grind me
to powder, but I have that in me which is above them,
which will own no obedience to them. Dead laws are,
so far as I can see, just what you and I and all mankind
have been put into this world to fight against. Call
them laws of nature if you will, I do not care. Take
the commonest, the most universal; is it or is it not by
the law of nature that the ground brings forth briers and
all sorts of noxious and useless weeds if you let it
alone? If it is by the law of nature, am I to obey the
law, or to dig my garden and root out the weeds?
Doubtless I shall get too old to dig, and shall die, and
the law will remain, and the weeds grow over my garden
and over my grave, but for all that I decline to obey the
law.</p>

<p>I see a law of death working all around me; I feel it
in my own members. Is this one of your laws, a part
of the “permanent order,” which is to serve me instead
of the God of my fathers? If it be I mean to resist it
to the last gasp. I utterly hate it. No noble or true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
work is done in this world except in direct defiance of
it. What is to become of the physician’s work, of every
effort at sanitary reform, of every attempt at civilizing
and raising the poor and the degraded, if we are to sit
down and submit ourselves to this law?</p>

<p>Am I never to build a house, out of respect to the
law of gravitation? Sooner or later the law will assert
itself, and my house will tumble down. Nevertheless I
will conquer the law for such space as I can. In short,
I will own no dead law as my master. Dead laws I
will hate always, and in all places, with all my heart,
with all my soul, with all my mind, and with all my
strength.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXI.</h2>


<p>We ought to welcome with all our hearts the searching
scrutiny, which students and philosophers of all
Christian nations, and of all shades of belief, whether
Christian or not, are engaged upon, as to the facts on
which our faith rests. The more thorough that scrutiny
is the better should we be pleased. We may not
wholly agree with the last position which the ablest investigators
have laid down, that unless the truth of the
history of our Lord—the facts of his life, death,
resurrection, and ascension—can be proved by ordinary
historical evidence, applied according to the most
approved and latest methods, Christianity must be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
up as not true. We know that our own certainty as to
these facts does not rest on a critical historical investigation,
while we rejoice that such an investigation
should be made by those who have leisure, and who are
competent for it. At the same time, as we also know
that the methods and principles of historical investigation
are constantly improving and being better understood,
and that the critics of the next generation will
work, in all human likelihood, at as great an advantage
in this inquiry over those who are now engaged in it, as
our astronomers and natural philosophers enjoy over
Newton and Franklin—and as new evidence may turn
up any day which may greatly modify their conclusions—we
cannot suppose that there is the least chance of their
settling the controversy in our time. Nor, even if we
thought them likely to arrive at definite conclusions, can
we consent to wait the results of their investigations,
important and interesting as these will be. Granting
then cheerfully, that if these facts on the study of which
they are engaged are not facts—if Christ was not crucified,
and did not rise from the dead, and ascend to
God his father—there has been no revelation, and
Christianity will infallibly go the way of all lies,
either under their assaults or those of their successors—they
must pardon us if even at the cost of being
thought and called fools for our pains, we deliberately
elect to live our lives on the contrary assumption. It is
useless to tell us that we know nothing of these things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that we can know nothing until their critical examination
is over; we can only say: “Examine away; but
we <i>do</i> know something of this matter, whatever you may
assert to the contrary, and, mean to live on the knowledge.”</p>

<p>But while we cannot suspend our judgment on the
question until we know how the critics and scholars have
settled it, we must do justice, before passing on, to the
single-mindedness, the reverence, the resolute desire
for the truth before all things, wherever the search for
it may land them which characterizes many of those who
are no longer of our faith, and are engaged in this inquiry,
or have set it aside as hopeless, and are working
at other tasks. The great advance of natural science
within the last few years, and the devotion with which
many of our ablest and best men are throwing themselves
into this study, are clearing the air in all the
higher branches of human thought and making possible
a nation, and in the end a world, of truthful men—that
blessedest result of all the strange conflicts and problems
of the age, which the wisest men have foreseen
in their most hopeful moods. In this grand movement
even those who are nominally, and believe themselves
to be really, against us, are for us: all at least who are
truthful and patient workers. For them, too, the spirit
of all truth, and patience, and wisdom is leading; and
their strivings and victories—aye, and their backslidings
and reverses—are making clearer day by day that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
revelation of the kingdom of God in nature, through
which it would seem that our generation, and those
which are to follow us, will be led back again to that
higher revelation of the kingdom of God in man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ideal American, as he has been painted for us of
late, is a man who has shaken off the yoke of definite
creeds, while retaining their moral essence, and finds
the highest sanctions needed for the conduct of human
life in experience tempered by common sense. Franklin,
for instance, is generally supposed to have reached
this ideal by anticipation, and there is a half-truth in the
supposition. But whoever will study this great master
of practical life will acknowledge that it is only superficially
true, and that if he never lifts us above the earth
or beyond the dominion of experience and common
sense, he retained himself a strong hold on the invisible
which underlies it, and would have been the first to acknowledge
that it was this which enabled him to control
the accidents of birth, education, and position, and to
earn the eternal gratitude and reverence of the great
nation over whose birth he watched so wisely, and
whose character he did so much to form.</p>

<p>“From one thing to another,” said Tom, “they got to
cathedrals, and one of them called St. Paul’s ‘a disgrace
to a Christian city.’ I couldn’t stand that, you
know. I was always bred to respect St. Paul’s; weren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“My education in that line was neglected,” said
Hardy, gravely. “And so you took up the cudgels for
St. Paul’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I plumped out that St. Paul’s was the finest
cathedral in England. You’d have thought I had said
that lying was one of the cardinal virtues—one or two
just treated me to a sort of pitying sneer, but my neighbors
were down upon me with a vengeance. I stuck to
my text though, and they drove me into saying I liked
the Ratcliffe more than any building in Oxford; which
I don’t believe I do, now I come to think of it. So
when they couldn’t get me to budge for their talk, they
took to telling me that everybody who knew anything
about church architecture was against me—of course
meaning that I knew nothing about it—for the matter
of that, I don’t mean to say that I do.” Tom paused;
it had suddenly occurred to him that there might be
some reason in the rough handling he had got.</p>

<p>“But what did you say to the authorities?” said
Hardy, who was greatly amused.</p>

<p>“Said I didn’t care a straw for them,” said Tom;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
“there was no right or wrong in the matter, and I had as
good a right to my opinion as Pugin—or whatever his
name is—and the rest.”</p>

<p>“What heresy!” said Hardy, laughing; “you caught
it for that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I! They made such a noise over it, that the
men at the other end of the table stopped talking (they
were all freshmen at our end), and when they found
what was up, one of the older ones took me in hand,
and I got a lecture about the middle ages, and the
monks. I said I thought England was well rid of the
monks; and then we got on to Protestantism, and fasting,
and apostolic succession, and passive obedience,
and I don’t know what all! I only know I was tired
enough of it before coffee came; but I couldn’t go, you
know, with all of them on me at once, could I?”</p>

<p>“Of course not; you were like the six thousand unconquerable
British infantry at Albuera. You held your
position by sheer fighting, suffering fearful loss.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, laughing, for he had talked himself
into good humor again. “I dare say I talked a deal
of nonsense; and, when I come to think it over, a good
deal of what some of them said had something in it. I
should like to hear it again quietly; but there were
others sneering and giving themselves airs, and that
puts a fellow’s back up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hardy, “a good many of the weakest and
vainest men who come up take to this sort of thing now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
They can do nothing themselves, and get a sort of platform
by going in for the High Church business from
which to look down on their neighbors.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I thought,” said Tom; “they tried
to push mother Church, mother Church, down my throat
at every turn. I’m as fond of the Church as any of
them, but I don’t want to be jumping up on her back every
minute, like a sickly chicken getting on the old hen’s
back to warm its feet whenever the ground is cold, and
fancying himself taller than all the rest of the brood.”</p>

<p>I have spoken of that which I cannot believe; let
me speak to you now of that which I do believe, of
that which I hold to be a faith, the faith, the only faith
for mankind. Do not turn from it because it seems to
be egotistic. I can only speak for myself, for what I
know in my own heart and conscience. While I keep
to this, I can speak positively, and I wish above all
things to speak positively.</p>

<p>I was bred as a child and as a boy to look upon
Christ as the true and rightful King and Head of our
race, the Son of God and the Son of man. When I
came to think for myself I found the want, the longing
for a perfectly righteous king and head, the deepest of
which I was conscious—for a being in whom I could
rest, who was in perfect sympathy with me and all men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
“Like as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so
longeth my soul after thee, O God. My soul is athirst
for God, yea, even for the living God,”—these, and the
like sayings of the Psalmist, began to have a meaning
for me.</p>

<p>Then the teaching which had sunk into me unconsciously
rose up and seemed to meet this longing. If
that teaching were true, here was He for whom I was in
search. I turned to the records of His life and death.
I read and considered as well as I could, the character
of Christ, what he said of himself and his work; his
teachings, his acts, his sufferings. Then I found that
this was indeed He. Here was the Head, the King,
for whom I had longed. The more I read and thought
the more absolutely sure I became of it. This is He.
I wanted no other then, I have never wanted another
since. Him I can look up to and acknowledge with the
most perfect loyalty. He satisfies me wholly. There is
no recorded thought, word or deed of his that I would
wish to change—that I do not recognize and rejoice in
as those of my rightful and righteous King and Head.
He has claimed for me, for you, for every man, all that
we can ask for or dream of, for He has claimed every
one of us for his soldiers and brethren, the acknowledged
children of his and our Father and God.</p>

<p>But this loyalty I could never have rendered, no man
can ever render, I believe, except to a Son of man.
He must be perfect man as well as perfect God to satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
us—must have dwelt in a body like ours, have felt
our sorrows, pains, temptations, weaknesses. He was
incarnate by the Spirit of God of the Virgin. In this
way I can see how he was indeed perfect God and perfect
Man. I can conceive of no other in which he
could have been so. The Incarnation is for me the
support of all personal holiness, and the key to human
history.</p>

<p>What was Christ’s work on earth? He came to make
manifest, to make clear to us, the will and nature of
this Father, our God. He made that will and nature
clear to us as the perfectly loving and long-suffering and
righteous will and nature. He came to lead us men,
his brethren, back into perfect understanding of and
submission to that will—to make us at one with
it; and this he did triumphantly by his own perfect
obedience to that will, by sacrificing himself even to
death for us, because it was the will of his and our
Father that he should give himself up wholly and unreservedly;
thus, by his one sacrifice, redeeming us and
leaving us an example that we too should sacrifice ourselves
to Him for our brethren. Thus I believe in the
Atonement.</p>

<h2>CXIV.</h2>


<p>Christ was not only revealed to those who saw him
here. He did not only go about doing his Father’s will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
here on earth for thirty-three years, eighteen hundred
years ago, and then leave us. Had this been so, he
would certainly in one sense have been revealed, in the
only sense in which some orthodox writers seem to
teach that he has been revealed. He would have been
revealed to certain men, at a certain time, in history,
and to us in the accounts which we have of him in the
Gospels, through which accounts only we should have
had to gain our knowledge of him, judging of such
accounts by our own fallible understandings. But He
said, “I will be with you always, even to the end of the
world.” “I will send my Spirit into your hearts to
testify of me;” and He has fulfilled his promise. He
is revealed, not in the Bible, not in history, not in or to
some men at a certain time, or to a man here and there,
but in the heart of you, and of me, and of every man
and woman who is now, or ever has been, on this earth.
His Spirit is in each of us, striving with us, cheering us,
guiding us, strengthening us. At any moment in the
lives of any one of us we may prove the fact for ourselves;
we may give ourselves up to his guidance, and
He will accept the trust, and guide us into the knowledge
of God, and of all truth. From this knowledge,
(more certain to me than any other, of which I am ten
thousand times more sure than I am that Queen Victoria
is reigning in England, that I am writing with this
pen at this table,) if I could see no other manifestation
of Christ in creation, I believe in the Trinity in Unity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the name on which all things in heaven and earth stand,
which meets and satisfies the deepest needs and longings
of my soul.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this name, of these truths, has
come to me, and to all men, in one sense, specially and
directly through the Scriptures. I believe that God has
given us these Scriptures, this Bible, to instruct us in
these the highest of all truths. Therefore I reverence
this Bible as I reverence no other book; but I reverence
it because it speaks of him, and his dealings with us.
The Bible has no charm or power of its own. It may
become a chain round men’s necks, an idol in the throne
of God, to men who will worship the book, and not
Him of whom the book speaks. There are many signs
that this is, or is fast becoming, the case with us; but it
is our fault, and not the Bible’s fault. We persist in
reading our own narrowness and idolatry into it, instead
of hearing what it really is saying to us.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXV.</h2>


<p>I believe that the writers of Holy Scripture were
directly inspired by God, in a manner, and to an extent,
in and to which no other men whose words have come
down to us have been inspired. I cannot draw the line
between their inspiration and that of other great teachers
of mankind. I believe that the words of these, too, just
in so far as they have proved themselves true words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
were inspired by God. But though I cannot, and man
cannot, draw the line, God himself has done so; for
these books have been filtered out, as it were, under his
guidance, from many others, which, in ages gone by,
claimed a place beside them, and are now forgotten,
while these have stood for thousands of years, and are
not likely to be set aside now. For they speak if men
will read them, to needs and hopes set deep in our
human nature, which no other books have ever spoken
to, or ever can speak to, in the same way—they set
forth his government of the world as no other books
ever have set it forth, or ever can set it forth.</p>

<p>But though I do not believe that the difference between
the inspiration of Isaiah and Shakespeare is expressible
by words, the difference between the inspiration
of the Holy Scripture—the Bible as a whole—and
any other possible or conceivable collection of the
utterances of men seems to me clear enough. The
Bible has come to us from the Jewish nation, which was
chosen by God as the one best fitted to receive for all
mankind, and to give forth to all mankind, the revelation
of Him—to teach them His name and character—that
is, to enable them to know Him and in knowing
Him, to feel how they and the world need redemption,
and to understand how they and the world have been
redeemed. This Bible, this Book of the chosen
people, taken as a whole, has done this, is in short the
written revelation of God. This being so, there can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
no other inspired book in the same sense in which the
Bible is inspired, unless we, or some other world, are
not redeemed, require another redemption and another
Christ. But as we and all worlds are redeemed, and
Christ is come, and God has revealed his name and
his character in Christ so that we can know Him, the
Bible is and must remain <i>the</i> inspired Book, the Book of
the Church for all time, to which nothing can be added,
from which nothing can be taken, as they will find who
try to take from it or add to it. There may be another
Homer, Plato, Shakespeare; there can be no other
Bible.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXVI.</h2>


<p>The longing for a Deliverer and Redeemer of himself
and his race was the strongest and deepest feeling
in the heart of every Jewish patriot. His whole life
was grounded and centred on the promise and hope of
such an one. Just therefore when his utterances would
be most human and noble, most in sympathy with the
cries and groanings of his own nation and the universe,
they would all point to and centre in that Deliverer and
Redeemer—just in so far as they were truly noble,
human, and Godlike, they would shadow forth His true
character, the words He would speak, the acts He
would do. Doubtless the prophet would have before
his mind any notable deliverance, and noble sufferer, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
deliverer of his own time; his words would refer to
these. But from these he would be inevitably drawn up
to the great promised Deliverer and Redeemer of his
nation and his race, because he would see after all how
incomplete the deliverance wrought by these must be,
and his faith in the promise made to his fathers and to
his nation—the covenant of God in which he felt
himself to be included—would and could be satisfied
with nothing less than a full and perfect deliverance, a
Redeemer who should be the Head of men, the Son of
man, and the Son of God.</p>

<p>Men may have insisted, may still insist, on seeing all
sorts of fanciful references to some special acts of his
in certain words of the Bible. But I must again insist
that men’s fancies about the Bible and Christ are not
the question, but what the Bible itself says, what Christ
is. The whole book is full of Him, there is no need to
read Him into any part of it as to which there can be
any possible doubt.</p>

<p>Holding this faith as to the Scriptures, I am not
anxious to defend them. I rejoice that they should be
minutely examined and criticised. They will defend
themselves, one and all, I believe. Men may satisfy
themselves—perhaps, if I have time to give to the study,
they may satisfy me—that the Pentateuch was the work
of twenty men; that Baruch wrote a part of Isaiah;
that David did not write the Psalms, or the Evangelists
the Gospels; that there are interpolations here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
there in the originals; that there are numerous and serious
errors in our translation. What is all this to me?
What do I care who wrote them, what is the date of
them, what this or that passage ought to be? They
have told me what I wanted to know. Burn every copy
in the world to-morrow, you don’t and can’t take that
knowledge from me, or any man. I find them <i>all</i> good
for me; so, as long as a copy is left, and I can get it, I
mean to go on reading them all, and believing them all
to be inspired.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXVII.</h2>


<p>Our Lord came proclaiming a kingdom of God, a
kingdom ordained by God on this earth, the order and
beauty of which the unruly and sinful wills of men had
deformed, so that disease, and death, and all miseries
and disorder, had grown up and destroyed the order of
it, and thwarting the perfectly loving will of God.</p>

<p>In asserting this kingdom and this order, our Lord
claimed (as he must have claimed if indeed he were
the Son of God) dominion over disease and death.
This dominion was lower than that over the human
heart and will, but he claimed it as positively. He
proved his claim to be good in other ways, but specially
for our present purpose by healing the sick, and raising
the dead. Were these works orderly or disorderly?
Every one of them seems to me to be the restoring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
an order which had been disturbed. They were
witnesses for the law of life, faithful and true manifestations
of the will of a loving Father to his children.</p>

<p>Yes, you may say, but he did other miracles besides
those of healing. He turned water into wine, stilled
the waves, multiplied loaves and fishes. These at any
rate were capricious suspensions of natural laws. You
say you believe in natural laws which have their ground
in God’s will. Such laws he suspended or set aside in
these cases. Now were these suspensions orderly?</p>

<p>I think they were. The natural laws which Christ
suspended, such as the law of increase, are laws of God.
Being his laws, they are living and not dead laws, but
they are not the highest law; there must be a law of
God, a law of his mind, above them, or they would be
dead tyrannous rules. Christ seems to me to have been
asserting the freedom of that law of God by suspending
these natural laws, and to have been claiming here again,
as part of his and our birthright, dominion over natural
laws.</p>

<p>All the other miracles, I believe, stand on the same
ground. None have been performed except by men
who felt that they were witnessing for God, with
glimpses of his order, full of zeal for the triumph of
that order in the world, and working as Christ worked,
in his spirit, and in the name of his Father, or of him.
If there are any miracles which do not on a fair examination
fulfil these conditions—which are such as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
loving Father educating sons who had strayed from or
rebelled against him would not have done—I am
quite ready to give them up.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXVIII.</h2>


<p>You have another charge against Christianity. You
say it is after all a selfish faith, in which, however beautiful
and noble the moral teaching may be, the ultimate
appeal has always been to the hope of reward and fear
of punishment. You will tell me that in ninety-nine of
our churches out of a hundred I shall hear this doctrine,
and shall find it in ninety-nine out of every hundred of
theological or religious works.</p>

<p>If it be so I am sorry for it. But I am speaking of
Christ’s Gospel, and I say that you will not find the
doctrine you protest against there. I cannot go through
our Lord’s teaching and his disciples’ to prove this. I
ask you to read for yourselves, bringing honest and
clear heads to the study, and not heads full of what
you have thought, or this and the other man has
preached or written, and I say that then you will give
up this charge.</p>

<p>But as I have tried to do in all other cases, so here,
I will tell you exactly what my own faith on this matter
is.</p>

<p>Christ has told me that the only reward I shall ever
get will be “life eternal,” and that life eternal is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
know God and Him. That is all the reward I care
about. The only punishment I can ever bring on myself
will be, to banish myself from his presence and the
presence of all who know him, to dwell apart from him
and my brethren, shut up in myself. That is the only
punishment I dread.</p>

<p>But this reward he has given us already, here. He
has given us to know God, and knowing God involves
entering his kingdom, and dwelling in it. That kingdom
Christ has opened to you, and to me, here. We,
you and I may enter in any hour we please. If we don’t
enter in now, and here, I can’t see how we are ever
likely to enter in in another world. Why should not
we enter in? It is worth trying. There are no conditions.
It is given for the asking.</p>

<p>I think you will find it all you are in search of and
are longing for. Above all, you will find in it and nowhere
else, rest, peace—“not a peace which depends
upon compacts and bargains among men, but which belongs
to the very nature and character and being of
God. Not a peace which is produced by the stifling and
suppression of activities and energies, but the peace in
which all activities and energies are perfected and
harmonized. Not a peace which comes from the toleration
of what is base or false, but which demands its
destruction. Not a peace which begins from without,
but a peace which is first wrought in the inner man, and
thence comes forth to subdue the world. Not a peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
which a man gets for himself by standing aloof from the
sorrows and confusions of the world in which he is born,
of the men whose nature he shares, choosing a calm retreat
and quiet scenery and a regulated atmosphere; but
a peace which has never thriven except in those who
have suffered with their suffering kind, who have been
ready to give up selfish enjoyments, sensual or spiritual,
for their sakes, who have abjured all devices of escape
from ordained toils and temptations; the peace which
was His who bore the sorrows and sins and infirmities
of man, who gave up himself that he might become
actually one with them, who thus won for them a participation
in the Divine nature, and inheritance in that
peace of God which passeth all understanding.”</p>

<p>This kingdom of God is good enough for me at any
rate. I can trust him who has brought me into it to
add what he will, to open my eyes, and strengthen my
powers, that I may see and enjoy ever more and more
of it, in this world, or in any other in which he may put
me hereafter. Where that may be is no care of mine;
it will be in his kingdom still, that I know; no power
in Heaven or Hell, or Earth can cast me out of that,
except I myself. While I remain in it I can freely use
and enjoy every blessing and good gift of his glorious
earth, the inheritance which he has given to us, his
father’s children, his brethren. When it shall be his
good pleasure to take me out of it he will not take me
out of but bring me into more perfect communion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
him and with my brethren. He nourisheth my heart
with good things on this earth, he will not cease to do
this anywhere else. He reveals himself to me here,
though as a man I cannot take in his full and perfect
revelation, but when I awake up after his likeness I
shall be satisfied—and not till then.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXIX.</h2>


<p>One stumbling block in your way is, you say, that you
are revolted and kept at arm’s-length by the separatist
and exclusive habits and maxims of those who profess
to have the faith you want. Many of them are kind,
exemplary men, but just because they are Christians,
and in so far forth as they are Christians, they are calling
to you to come out from amongst the people of the
world—to separate yourselves from an adulterous generation.</p>

<p>Against this call something which you know to be true
and noble in you rises up. You have felt that what
your age is crying out for, is union. You acknowledge
the power of that cry in your own hearts. You want
to feel with all men, and for all men. If you need a
faith at all, it is one which shall meet that cry, which
shall teach you how all men are bound together; not
how some may be separated from the rest. You will
not be false to your age. You will have no faith at all,
or a faith for all mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Keep to that; take nothing less than that; only look
again and see whether that is not just what Christ offers
you. Again I urge you not to look at his followers, real
or professing—look at him, look at his life.</p>

<p>Was He exclusive? Did ever man or woman come
near him and he turn away? Did he not go amongst all
ranks, into every society? Did he not go to the houses
of great men and rulers; of Pharisees, of poor men, of
publicans? Did he not frequent the temple, the marketplace,
the synagogue, the sea-shore, the hillside, the
haunts of outcasts and harlots? Was he not to be found
at feasts and at funerals? Wherever men and women
were to be found, there was his place and his work;
and there is ours. He who believes in him must go
into every society where he has any call whatever.
Who are we that we should pick and choose? The
greatest ruffian, the most abandoned woman, that ever
walked the face of this earth, were good enough for our
Lord to die for. If he sends us amongst them, he will
take care of us, and has something for us to do or
speak, for or to them. The greatest king, the holiest
saint on earth, is not too high company for one for whom
Christ died, as he did for you and me. So, if he sends
us amongst great or holy people, let us go, and learn
what he means us to learn there.</p>

<p>I know how deeply many of you feel and mourn over
the miseries and disorder of England and the world—how
you long to do something towards lightening ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
so small a part of those miseries, rescuing ever so
small a corner of the earth from that disorder. I know
well how earnestly many of you are working in one way
or another for your country and your brethren. I know
what high hopes many of you have for the future of the
world and the destiny of man. I say, mourn on, work
on; abate not one jot of any hope you have ever had
for the world or for man. Your hopes, be they what
they may, have never been high enough—your work
never earnest enough. But I ask you whether your
hopes and your work have not been marred again and
again, whether you have not been thrown back again
and again into listlessness and hopelessness, by failures
of one kind or another, whether you have not felt that
those failures have been caused more or less by your
own uncertainty, by your having had to work and fight
without a leader, with comrades to whom you were
bound only by chance, to journey without any clear
knowledge of the road you were going, or where it led
to?</p>

<p>At such times have you not longed for light and
guidance? What would you have not given for a well of
light and hope and strength, springing up within you
and renewing your powers and energies? What would
you not have given for the inward certainty that the
road you were travelling was the right one, however you
might stumble on it; that the line of battle in which
you stood was the line for all true men, and was marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
break at the point which had been given you to hold,
whatever might become of you? Well, be sure that
light and guidance, that renewal of strength and hope,
that certainty as to your side and your road, you are
meant to have; they have been prepared, and are ready,
for every man of you, whenever you will take them.
The longings for them are whispered in your hearts by
the Leader, whose cross, never turned back, ever
triumphing more and more over all principalities and
powers of evil, blazes far ahead in the van of our
battles. He has been called the Captain of our Salvation,
the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Lamb who was
slain for the world; He has told us his name, the Son
of God and the Son of Man; He has claimed to be
the redeemer, deliverer, leader of mankind.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXX.</h2>


<p>My younger brothers, I am not speaking to you the
words of enthusiasm or excitement, but the words of
sober every-day knowledge and certainty. I tell you
that all the miseries of England and of other lands consist
simply in this and in nothing else, that we men,
made in the image of God, made to know him, to be one
with him in his Son, will not confess that Son our Lord
and Brother, to be the Son of God and Son of man, the
living Head of our race and of each one of us. I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
you that if we would confess him and lay hold of him
and let him enter into and rule and guide us and the
world, instead of trying to rule and guide ourselves and
the world without him, we should see and know that the
kingdom of God is just as much about us now as it will
ever be. I tell you that we should see all sorrow and
misery melting away and drawn up from this fair world
of God’s like mountain mist before the July sun.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXXI.</h2>


<p>I do not ask you to adopt any faith of mine. But as
you would do good work in your generation, I ask of
you to give yourselves no peace till you have answered
these questions, each one for himself, in the very secret
recesses of his heart, “Do I, does my race, want a
head? Can we be satisfied with any less than a Son of
man and a Son of God? Is this Christ, who has been
so long worshipped in England, He?”</p>

<p>If you can answer, though with faltering lips, “Yes,
this is He,” I care very little what else you accept, all
else that is necessary or good for you will come in due
time, if once he has the guidance of you.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXXII.</h2>


<p>My faith has been no holiday or Sunday faith, but
one for every-day use; a faith to live and die in, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
argue or talk about. It has had to stand the wear and
tear of life; it was not got in prosperity. It has had to
carry me through years of anxious toil and small means,
through the long sicknesses of those dearer to me than
my own life, through deaths amongst them both sudden
and lingering. Few men of my age have had more
failures of all kinds; no man has deserved them more,
by the commission of all kinds of blunders and errors,
by evil tempers, and want of faith, hope, and love.</p>

<p>Through all this it has carried me, and has risen up
in me after every failure and every sorrow, fresher,
clearer, stronger. Why do I say “<i>it</i>?” I mean He.
He has carried me through it all; He who is your
Head and the Head of every man, woman, child, on
this earth, or who has ever been on it, just as much as
he is my Head. And he will carry us all through every
temptation, trial, sorrow, we can ever have to encounter,
in this world or any other, if we will only turn to him,
lay hold of him, and cast them all upon him, as he has
bidden us.</p>

<p>My younger brothers, you on whom the future of your
country, under God, at this moment depends, will you
not try him? Is he not worth a trial?</p>

<p>Precious as his love was to him, and deeply as it
affected his whole life, Tom felt that there must be something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
beyond it—that its full satisfaction would not be
enough for him. The bed was too narrow for a man to
stretch himself on. What he was in search of must underlie
and embrace his human love, and support it.
Beyond and above all private and personal desires and
hopes and longings, he was conscious of a restless craving
and feeling about after something which he could
not grasp, and yet which was not avoiding him, which
seemed to be mysteriously laying hold of him and surrounding
him.</p>

<p>The routine of chapels, and lectures, and reading for
degree, boating, cricketing, Union-debating—all well
enough in their way—left this vacuum unfilled. There
was a great outer visible world, the problems and puzzles
of which were rising before him and haunting him
more and more; and a great inner and invisible world
opening round him in awful depth. He seemed to be
standing on the brink of each—now, shivering and
helpless, feeling like an atom about to be whirled into
the great flood and carried he knew not where—now,
ready to plunge in and take his part, full of hope and
belief that he was meant to buffet in the strength of a
man with the seen and the unseen, and to be subdued
by neither.</p>

story; but start not at the phrase, though you may
never have found its meaning.—He laid the whole before
the Lord, in prayer, for his friend, for himself, for

<p>And you, too, if ever you are tried—as every man
must be in one way or another—must learn to do the
like with every burthen on your soul, if you would not
have it hanging round you heavily, and ever more heavily,
and dragging you down lower and lower till your
dying day.</p>

<h2>CXXV.</h2>


<p>The English prejudice against Franklin on religious
grounds is quite unreasonable. He was suspected of
being a Freethinker, and was professedly a philosopher
and man of science; he was a friend of Tom Paine and
other dreadful persons; he had actually published “An
Abridgment of the Church Prayer-Book,” dedicated “to
the serious and discerning,” by the use of which he had
the audacity to suppose that religion would be furthered,
unanimity increased, and a more frequent attendance on
the worship of God secured. Any one of these charges
was sufficient to ruin a man’s religious reputation in
respectable England of the last generation, but it is high
time that amends were made in these days. Let us
glance at the real facts. As a boy, Franklin had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
disease which all thoughtful boys have to pass through,
and puzzled himself with speculations as to the attributes
of God and the existence of evil, which landed
him in the conclusion that nothing could possibly be
wrong in the world, and that vice and virtue were
empty distinctions. These views he published at the
mature age of nineteen, but became disgusted with them
almost immediately, and abandoned metaphysics for
other more satisfactory studies. Living in the eighteenth
century, when happiness was held to be “our
being’s end and aim,” he seems to have now conformed
to that popular belief; but as he came also to the conclusion
that “the felicity of life” was to be attained
through “truth, sincerity, and integrity in dealings between
man and man,” and acted up to this conclusion,
no great objection from a moral or religious standpoint
can be taken to this stage of his development. At the
age of twenty-two he composed a little liturgy for his
own use, which he fell back on when the sermons of the
minister of the only Presbyterian church in Philadelphia
had driven him from attendance at chapel. He
did not, however, long remain unattached, and after his
marriage joined the Church of England, in which he
remained till the end of his life. What his sentiments
were in middle life may be gathered from his advice to
his daughter on the eve of his third departure for
England: “Go constantly to church, whoever preaches.
The act of devotion in the Common Prayer-Book is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
your principle business there, and if properly attended
to will do more toward amending the heart than sermons....
I do not mean you should despise
sermons, even of the preachers you dislike, for the
discourse is often much better than the man, as sweet
and clear waters come through very dirty earth. I am
the more particular on this head as you seem to express
some inclination to leave our church, which I would not
have you do.” As an old man of eighty, he reminded
his colleagues of the National Convention (in moving
unsuccessfully that there should be daily prayers before
business) how in the beginnings of the contest with
Britain “we had daily prayers in this room....
Do we imagine we no longer need assistance? I have
lived now a long time, and the longer I live the more
convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God rules in
the affairs of men.” Later yet, in answer to President
Yates, of Yale College, who had pressed him on the
subject, he writes, at the age of eighty-four: “Here is
my creed: I believe in one God, the Creator of the
universe; that he governs it by his providence; that he
ought to be worshipped; that the most acceptable
service we render to him is doing good to his other
children; that the soul of man is immortal, and will be
treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct
in this.” These are his “fundamentals,” beyond
which he believes that Christ’s system of morals and
religion is the best the world is ever likely to see, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
it has been much corrupted. To another friend he
speaks with cheerful courage of death, which “I shall
submit to with less regret as, having seen during a long
life a good deal of this world, I feel a growing curiosity
to be acquainted with some other; and can cheerfully,
with filial confidence, resign my spirit to the conduct of
that great and good Parent of mankind who has so
graciously protected and prospered me from my birth to
the present hour.” One more quotation we cannot
resist; it is his farewell letter to his old friend David
Hartley: “I cannot quit the coasts of Europe without
taking leave of my old friend. We were long fellow-laborers
in the best of all works, the work of peace.
I leave you still in the field, but, having finished my
day’s task, I am going home to bed. Wish me a good
night’s rest, as I do you a pleasant evening. Adieu,
and believe me ever yours most affectionately,—<span class="smcap">B.
Franklin</span>.”</p>

<p>As to his relations with Paine, they should have reassured
instead of frightened the orthodox, for he did his
best to keep the author of “The Rights of Man” from
publishing his speculations. Franklin advises him that
he will do himself mischief and no benefit to others.
“He who spits against the wind, spits in his own face.”
Paine is probably indebted to religion “for the habits of
virtue on which you so justly value yourself. You might
easily display your excellent talents of reasoning upon a
less hazardous subject, and thereby obtain a rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
amongst our most distinguished authors. For among
us it is not necessary, as among the Hottentots, that a
youth, to be raised into the company of men, should
prove his manhood by beating his mother.”</p>

<p>Of course, it is more satisfactory to one’s own self-love,
to make every one who comes to one to learn, feel
that he is a fool, and we wise men; but, if our object is
to teach well and usefully what we know ourselves there
cannot be a worse method. No man, however, is likely
to adopt it, so long as he is conscious that he has anything
himself to learn from his pupils; and as soon as
he has arrived at the conviction that they can teach him
nothing—that it is henceforth to be all give and no
take—the sooner he throws up his office of teacher the
better it will be for himself, his pupils, and his country,
whose sons he is misguiding.</p>

<p>“When one thinks what a great centre of learning
and faith like Oxford ought to be—that its highest educational
work should just be the deliverance of us all
from flunkeyism and money-worship—and then looks
at matters here without rose-colored spectacles, it gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
one sometimes a sort of chilly, leaden despondency,
which is very hard to struggle against.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear you talk like that, Jack, for one
can’t help loving the place after all.”</p>

<p>“So I do, God knows. If I didn’t, I shouldn’t care
for its shortcomings.”</p>

<p>“Well, the flunkeyism and money-worship were bad
enough, but I don’t think they were the worst things—at
least not in my day. Our neglects were almost worse
than our worships.”</p>

<p>“You mean the want of all reverence for parents?
Well, perhaps that lies at the root of the false worships.
They spring up on the vacant soil.”</p>

<p>“And the want of reverence for women, Jack. The
worst of all, to my mind!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right. But we are not at the
bottom yet.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that we must worship God before we can
reverence parents or women, or root out flunkeyism and
money-worship.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But after all can we fairly lay that sin on Oxford?
Surely, whatever may be growing up side by
side with it, there’s more Christianity here than almost
anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of common-room Christianity—belief in a
dead God. There, I have never said it to any one but
you, but that is the slough we have got to get out of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Don’t think that I despair for us. We shall do it yet;

wine-party religion in which we are wrapped up—work
for our strongest and our wisest.”</p>

<p>Everybody, I suppose, knows the dreamy delicious
state in which one lies, half asleep, half awake, while consciousness
begins to return after a sound night’s rest in
a new place which we are glad to be in, following upon
a day of unwonted excitement and exertion. There are
few pleasanter pieces of life. The worst of it is that
they last such a short time; for nurse them as you will,
by lying perfectly passive in mind and body, you can’t
make more than five minutes or so of them. After
which time the stupid, obstrusive, wakeful entity which
we call “I,” as impatient as he is stiff-necked, spite of
our teeth will force himself back again, and take possession
of us down to our very toes.</p>

<p>The sun was going down behind the copse, through
which his beams came aslant, chequered and mellow.
The stream ran dimpling down, sleepily swaying the
masses of weed, under the surface and on the surface;
and the trout rose under the banks, as some moth or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
gnat or gleaming beetle fell into the stream; here and
there one more frolicsome than his brethren would
throw himself joyously into the air. The swifts rushed
close by, in companies of five or six, and wheeled, and
screamed, and dashed away again, skimming along the
water, baffling the eye as one tried to follow their flight.
Two kingfishers shot suddenly up on to their supper
station, on a stunted willow stump, some twenty yards
below him, and sat there in the glory of their blue backs
and cloudy red waistcoats, watching with long sagacious
beaks pointed to the water beneath, and every now
and then dropping like flashes of light into the stream,
and rising again, with what seemed one motion, to their
perches. A heron or two were fishing about the
meadows; and Tom watched them stalking about in
their sober quaker coats, or rising on slow heavy wing,
and lumbering away home with a weird cry. He
heard the strong pinions of the wood pigeon in the air,
and then from the trees above his head came the soft
call, “Take-two-cow-Taffy, take-two-cow-Taffy,” with
which that fair and false bird is said to have beguiled
the hapless Welchman to the gallows. Presently, as he
lay motionless, the timid and graceful little water-hens
peered out from their doors in the rushes opposite, and,
seeing no cause for fear, stepped daintily into the water,
and were suddenly surrounded by little bundles of black
soft down, which went paddling about in and out of the
weeds, encouraged by the occasional sharp, clear, parental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
“keck—keck,” and merry little dabchicks popped
up in mid-stream, and looked round, and nodded at him,
pert and voiceless, and dived again; even old cunning
water-rats sat up on the bank with round black noses
and gleaming eyes, or took solemn swims out, and
turned up their tails and disappeared for his amusement.
A comfortable low came at intervals from the
cattle, revelling in the abundant herbage. All living
things seemed to be disporting themselves, and enjoying,
after their kind, the last gleams of the sunset, which
were making the whole vault of heaven glow and shimmer;
and, as he watched them, Tom blessed his stars
as he contrasted the river-side with the glare of lamps
and the click of balls in the noisy pool-room.</p>

<p>And then the summer twilight came on, and the birds
disappeared, and the hush of night settled down on
river, and copse, and meadow—cool and gentle summer
twilight, after the hot bright day. He welcomed it
too, as it folded up the landscape, and the trees lost
their outline, and settled into soft black masses rising
here and there out of the white mist, which seemed to
have crept up to within a few yards all round him unawares.
There was no sound now but the gentle murmur
of the water, and an occasional rustle of reeds, or
of the leaves over his head, as a stray wandering puff
of air passed through them on its way home to bed.
Nothing to listen to, and nothing to look at; for the
moon had not risen, and the light mist hid everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
except a star or two right up above him. So, the outside
world having left him for the present, he was turned
inwards on himself.</p>

<p>The nights are pleasant in May, short and pleasant
for travel. We will leave the city asleep, and do our
flight in the night to save time. Trust yourselves, then,
to the story-teller’s aërial machine. It is but a rough
affair, I own, rough and humble, unfitted for high or
great flights, with no gilded panels, or dainty cushions,
or C-springs—not that we shall care about springs, by
the way, until we alight on terra-firma again—still, there
is much to be learned in a third-class carriage if we will
only not look while in it for cushions, and fine panels,
and forty miles an hour travelling, and will not be
shocked at our fellow-passengers for being weak in their
h’s and smelling of fustian. Mount in it, then, you who
will, after this warning; the fares are holiday fares, the
tickets return tickets. Take with you nothing but the

<p class="unindent">and may you have a pleasant journey, for it is time that
the stoker should be looking to his going gear!</p>

<p>So now we rise slowly in the moonlight from St. Ambrose’s
quadrangle, and, when we are clear of the clock-tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
steer away southwards, over Oxford city and all
its sleeping wisdom and folly, over street and past spire,
over Christ Church and the canons’ houses, and the
fountain in Tom quad; over St. Aldate’s and the river,
along which the moonbeams lie in a pathway of twinkling
silver, over the railway sheds—no, there was then
no railway, but only the quiet fields and foot-paths of
Hincksey hamlet. Well, no matter; at any rate, the
hills beyond, and Bagley Wood, were there then as now:
and over hills and wood we rise, catching the purr of
the night-jar, the trill of the nightingale, and the first
crow of the earliest cock-pheasant, as he stretches his
jewelled wings, conscious of his strength and his beauty,
heedless of the fellows of St. John’s, who slumber within
sight of his perch, on whose hospitable board he shall
one day lie, prone on his back, with fair larded breast
turned upwards for the carving knife, having crowed his
last crow. He knows it not; what matters it to him? If
he knew it, could a Bagley Wood cock-pheasant desire
a better ending?</p>

<p>We pass over the vale beyond; hall and hamlet,
church, and meadow, and copse, folded in mist and
shadow below us, each hamlet holding in its bosom the
materials of three-volumed novels by the dozen, if we
could only pull off the roofs of the houses and look
steadily into the interiors; but our destination is farther
yet. The faint white streak behind the distant Chilterns
reminds us that we have no time for gossip by the way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
May nights are short, and the sun will be up by four.
No matter; our journey will now be soon over, for the
broad vale is crossed, and the chalk hills and downs
beyond. Larks quiver up by us, “higher, ever higher,”
hastening up to get a first glimpse of the coming monarch,
careless of food, flooding the fresh air with song.
Steady plodding rooks labor along below us, and lively
starlings rush by on the look-out for the early worm;
lark and swallow, rook and starling, each on his
appointed round. The sun arises, and they get them to
it; he is up now, and these breezy uplands over which
we hang are swimming in the light of horizontal rays,
though the shadows and mists still lie on the wooded
dells which slope away southwards.</p>

<p>This is no chalk, this high knoll which rises above—one
may almost say hangs over—the village, crowned
with Scotch firs, its sides tufted with gorse and heather.
It is the Hawk’s Lynch, the favorite resort of Englebourn
folk, who come up for the view, for the air,
because their fathers and mothers came up before them,
because they came up themselves as children—from an
instinct which moves them all in leisure hours and
Sunday evenings, when the sun shines and the birds
sing, whether they care for view or air or not. Something
guides all their feet hitherward; the children, to
play hide-and-seek and look for nests in the gorse-bushes;
young men and maidens, to saunter and look
and talk, as they will till the world’s end—or as long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
at any rate, as the Hawk’s Lynch and Englebourn last—and
to cut their initials, inclosed in a true lover’s
knot, on the short rabbit’s turf; steady married couples,
to plod along together consulting on hard times and
growing families; even old tottering men, who love to
sit at the feet of the firs, with chins leaning on their
sticks, prattling of days long past, to any one who will
listen, or looking silently with dim eyes into the summer
air, feeling perhaps in their spirits after a wider and
more peaceful view which will soon open for them. A
common knoll, open to all, up in the silent air, well away
from every-day Englebourn life, with the Hampshire
range and the distant Beacon Hill lying soft on the
horizon, and nothing higher between you and the
southern sea, what a blessing the Hawk’s Lynch is to
the village folk, one and all! May Heaven and a
thankless soil long preserve it and them from an inclosure
under the Act!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXXXI.</h2>


<p>In January, 878, King Alfred disappears from the
eyes of Saxon and Northmen, and we follow him, by
such light as tradition throws upon these months, into
the thickets and marshes of Selwood. It is at this point,
as is natural enough, that romance has been most busy,
and it has become impossible to disentangle the actual
facts from monkish legend and Saxon ballad. In happier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
times Alfred was in the habit himself of talking
over the events of his wandering life pleasantly with his
courtiers, and there is no reason to doubt that the foundation
of most of the stories still current rests on those
conversations of the truth-loving king, noted down by
Bishop Asser and others.</p>

<p>The best known of these is, of course, the story of the
cakes. In the depths of the Saxon forests there were
always a few neat-herds and swine-herds, scattered up
and down, living in rough huts enough we may be sure,
and occupied with the care of the cattle and herds of
their masters. Amongst these in Selwood was a neat-herd
of the king, a faithful man, to whom the secret of
Alfred’s disguise was intrusted, and who kept it even
from his wife. To this man’s hut the king came one
day alone, and, sitting himself down by the burning
logs on the hearth, began mending his bows and arrows.
The neat-herd’s wife had just finished her baking, and,
having other household matters to attend to, confided
her loaves to the king, a poor, tired looking body, who
might be glad of the warmth, and could make himself
useful by turning the batch, and so earn his share while
she got on with other business. But Alfred worked
away at his weapons, thinking of anything but the good
housewife’s batch of loaves, which in due course were
not only done, but rapidly burning to a cinder. At this
moment the neat-herd’s wife comes back, and flying to
the hearth to rescue the bread, cries out, “D’rat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
man! never to turn the loaves when you see them burning.
I’ze warrant you ready enough to eat them when
they’re done.” But beside the king’s faithful neat-herd,
whose name is not preserved, there are other churls in
the forest, who must be Alfred’s comrades just now if
he will have any. And even here he has an eye for a
good man, and will lose no opportunity to help one to
the best of his power. Such a one he finds in a certain
swine-herd called Denewulf, whom he gets to know, a
thoughtful Saxon man, minding his charge there in the
oak woods. The rough churl, or thrall, we know not
which, has great capacity, as Alfred soon finds out, and
desire to learn. So the king goes to work upon Denewulf
under the oak trees, when the swine will let him,
and is well satisfied with the results of his teachings and
the progress of his pupil.</p>

<p>But in those miserable days the commonest necessaries
of life were hard enough to come by for the king
and his few companions, and for his wife and family,
who soon joined him in the forest, even if they were not
with him from the first. The poor foresters cannot
maintain them, nor are this band of exiles the men to
live on the poor. So Alfred and his comrades are soon
foraging on the borders of the forest, and getting what
subsistence they can from the Pagan, or from the Christians
who had submitted to their yoke. So we may imagine
them dragging on life till near Easter when a
gleam of good news comes up from the west, to gladden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the hearts and strengthen the arms of these poor men
in the depths of Selwood.</p>

<p>Soon after Guthrum and the main body of the Pagans
moved from Gloster, southwards, the Viking Hubba, as
had been agreed, sailed with thirty ships of war from his
winter quarters on the South Welsh coast, and landed
in Devon. The news of the catastrophe at Chippenham,
and of the disappearance of the king, was no doubt
already known in the west; and in the face of it Odda
the alderman cannot gather strength to meet the Pagans
in the open field. But he is a brave and true man, and
will make no term with the spoilers; so, with other
faithful thegns of King Alfred and their followers, he
throws himself into a castle or fort called Cynwith, or
Cynnit, there to abide whatever issue of this business
God will send them. Hubba, with the war-flag Raven,
and a host laden with the spoil of rich Devon vales, appear
in due course before the place. It is not strong
naturally, and has only “walls in our own fashion,”
meaning probably rough earth-works. But there are
resolute men behind them, and on the whole Hubba declines
the assault, and sits down before the place.
There is no spring of water, he hears, within the Saxon
lines, and they are otherwise wholly unprepared for a
siege. A few days will no doubt settle the matter, and
the sword or slavery will be the portion of Odda and the
rest of Alfred’s men; meantime there is spoil enough
in the camp from Devonshire homesteads, which brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
men can revel in round the war-flag Raven, while they
watch the Saxon ramparts. Odda, however, has quite
other views than death from thirst, or surrender. Before
any stress comes, early one morning, he and his
whole force sally out over their earth-works, and from
the first “cut down the Pagans in great numbers;”
eight hundred and forty warriors (some say one thousand
two hundred), with Hubba himself, are slain before
Cynnit fort; the rest, few in number, escape to their
ships. The war-flag Raven is left in the hands of Odda
and the men of Devon.</p>

<p>This is the news which comes to Alfred, Ethelnoth
the alderman of Somerset, Denewulf the swine-herd,
and the rest of the Selwood Forest group, some time
before Easter. These men of Devonshire, it seems, are
still staunch, and ready to peril their lives against the
Pagans. No doubt up and down Wessex, thrashed and
trodden out as the nation is by this time, there are other
good men and true, who will neither cross the sea or the
Welsh marches, nor make terms with the Pagan;
some sprinkling of men who will yet set life at stake,
for faith in Christ and love of England. If these can
only be rallied, who can say what may follow? So, in
the lengthening days of spring, council is held in Selwood
and there will have been Easter services in some
chapel, or hermitage, in the forest, or, at any rate in
some quiet glade. The “day of days” will surely have
had its voice of hope for this poor remnant. Christ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
risen and reigns; and it is not in these heathen Danes,
or in all the Northmen who ever sailed across the sea,
to put back his kingdom, or enslave those whom he has
freed.</p>

<p>The result is, that, far away from the eastern boundary
of the forest, on a rising ground—hill it can scarcely
be called—surrounded by dangerous marshes formed
by the little rivers Thone and Parret, fordable only in
summer, and even then dangerous to all who have not
the secret, a small fortified camp is thrown up under
Alfred’s eye, by Ethelnoth and the Somersetshire men,
where he can once again raise his standard. The spot
has been chosen by the king with the utmost care, for
it is his last throw. He names it the Etheling’s eig or
island, “Athelney.” Probably his young son, the
Etheling of England, is there amongst the first, with his
mother and his grand-mother Eadburgha, the widow of
Ethelred Mucil, the venerable lady whom Asser saw in
later years, and who has now no country but her
daughter’s. There are, as has been reckoned, some two
acres of hard ground on the island, and around vast
brakes of alder-bush, full of deer and other game.
Here the Somersetshire men can keep up constant
communication with him, and a small army grows together.
They are soon strong enough to make forays
into the open country, and in many skirmishes they cut
off parties of the Pagans, and supplies. “For, even
when overthrown and cast down,” says Malmesbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
“Alfred had always to be fought with; so then, when
one would esteem him altogether worn down and broken,
like a snake slipping from the hand of him who would
grasp it, he would suddenly flash out again from his
hiding-places, rising up to smite his foes in the height
of their insolent confidence, and never more hard to
beat than after a flight.”</p>

<p>But it was still a trying life at Athelney. Followers
came in slowly, and provender and supplies of all kinds
are hard to wring from the Pagan, and harder still to
take from Christian men. One day, while it was yet so
cold that the water was still frozen, the king’s people had
gone out “to get them fish or fowl, or some such purveyance
as they sustained themselves withal.” No one
was left in the royal hut for the moment but himself and
his mother-in-law, Eadburgha. The king (after his constant
wont whensoever he had opportunity) was reading
from the Psalms of David, out of the Manual which he
carried always in his bosom. At this moment a poor
man appeared at the door and begged for a morsel of
bread “for Christ his sake.” Whereupon the king, receiving
the stranger as a brother, called to his mother-in-law
to give him to eat. Eadburgha replied that there
was but one loaf in their store, and a little wine in a
pitcher, a provision wholly insufficient for his own family
and people. But the king bade her, nevertheless,
to give the stranger part of the last loaf, which she accordingly
did. But when he had been served, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
stranger was no more seen, and the loaf remained
whole, and the pitcher full to the brim. Alfred, meantime,
had turned to his reading, over which he fell asleep
and dreamed that St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne stood by
him, and told him it was he who had been his guest,
and that God had seen his afflictions and those of his
people, which were now about to end, in token whereof
his people would return that day from their expedition
with a great take of fish. The king awaking, and
being much impressed with his dream, called to his
mother-in-law and recounted it to her, who thereupon assured
him that she too had been overcome with sleep,
and had had the same dream. And while they yet
talked together on what had happened so strangely to
them, their servants came in, bringing fish enough, as it
seemed to them, to have fed an army.</p>

<p>The monkish legend goes on to tell that on the next
morning the king crossed to the mainland in a boat,
and wound his horn thrice, which drew to him before
noon five hundred men. What we may think of the
story and the dream, as Sir John Spelman says, “is not
here very much material,” seeing that whether we deem
it natural or supernatural, “the one as well as the other
serves at God’s appointment, by raising or dejecting of
the mind with hopes or fears, to lead man to the resolution
of those things whereof he has before ordained the
event.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Winburn is ill, isn’t she?” asked Tom, after
looking his guide over.</p>

<p>“Ees, her be—terrible bad,” said the constable.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with her, do you know?”</p>

<p>“Zummat o’ fits, I hears. Her’ve had ’em this six
year, on and off.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s dangerous. I mean she isn’t likely
to get well?”</p>

<p>“’Tis in the Lord’s hands,” replied the constable,
“but her’s that bad wi’ pain, at times, ’twould be a
mussy if ’twoud plaase He to tak’ her out on’t.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she mightn’t think so,” said Tom, superciliously;
he was not in the mind to agree with any one.
The constable looked at him solemnly for a moment and
then said:</p>

<p>“Her’s been a God-fearin’ woman from her youth up,
and her’s had a deal o’ trouble. Thaay as the Lord
loveth He chasteneth, and ’tisn’t such as thaay as is
afeard to go afore Him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never found that having trouble made people
a bit more anxious to get ‘out on’t,’ as you call it,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“It don’t seem to me as you can ’a had much o’

to be nettled by Tom’s manner.</p>

<p>“How can you tell that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h2>CXXXIV.</h2>


<p>Grey, who had never given up hopes of bringing Tom
round to his own views, had not neglected the opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
which his residence in town offered, and had
enlisted Tom’s services on more than one occasion.
He had found him specially useful in instructing the
big boys, whom he was trying to bring together and
civilize in a “Young Men’s Club,” in the rudiments of
cricket on Saturday evenings. But on the morning in
question an altogether different work was on hand.</p>

<p>A lady living some eight or nine miles to the northwest
of London, who took great interest in Grey’s
doings, had asked him to bring the children of his night-school
down to spend a day in her grounds, and this was
the happy occasion. It was before the days of cheap
excursions by rail, so that vans had to be found for the
party; and Grey had discovered a benevolent remover
of furniture in Paddington, who was ready to take them
at a reasonable figure. The two vans, with awnings and
curtains in the height of the fashion, and horses with
tasselled ear-caps, and everything handsome about them,
were already drawn up in the midst of a group of
excited children, and scarcely less excited mothers, when
Tom arrived. Grey was arranging his forces, and laboring
to reduce the Irish children, who formed almost
half of his ragged little flock, into something like order
before starting. By degrees this was managed, and
Tom was placed in command of the rear van, while
Grey reserved the leading one to himself. The children
were divided, and warned not to lean over the sides and
tumble out—a somewhat superfluous caution, as most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of them, though unused to riding in any legitimate
manner, were pretty well used to balancing themselves
behind any vehicle which offered as much as a spike to
sit on, out of sight of the driver. Then came the rush
into the vans. Grey and Tom took up their places next
the doors as conductors, and the procession lumbered
off with great success, and much shouting from treble
voices.</p>

<p>Tom soon found that he had plenty of work on his
hands to keep the peace amongst his flock. The Irish
element was in a state of wild effervescence, and he had
to draft them down to his own end, leaving the foremost
part of the van to the sober English children. He was
much struck by the contrast of the whole set to the
Englebourn school children, whom he had lately seen
under somewhat similar circumstances. The difficulty
with them had been to draw them out, and put anything
like life into them; here, all he had to do was to repress
the superabundant life. However, the vans held on
their way, and got safely into the suburbs, and so at last
to an occasional hedge, and a suspicion of trees, and
green fields beyond.</p>

<p>It became more and more difficult now to keep the
boys in; and when they came to a hill, where the horses
had to walk, he yielded to their entreaties, and, opening
the door, let them out, insisting only that the girls
should remain seated. They scattered over the sides of
the roads, and up the banks; now chasing pigs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
fowls up to the very doors of their owners; now gathering
the commonest road-side weeds, and running up to
show them to him, and ask their names, as if they were
rare treasures. The ignorance of most of the children
as to the commonest country matters astonished him.
One small boy particularly came back time after time to
ask him, with solemn face, “Please, sir, is this the
country?” and when at last he allowed that it was, rejoined,
“Then, please, where are the nuts?”</p>

<p>The clothing of most of the Irish boys began to tumble
to pieces in an alarming manner. Grey had insisted
on their being made tidy for the occasion, but the tidiness
was of a superficial kind. The hasty stitching soon
began to give way, and they were rushing about with
wild locks; the strips of what might have once been
nether garments hanging about their legs; their feet
and heads bare, the shoes which their mothers had borrowed
for the state occasion having been deposited
under the seat of the van, so when the procession arrived
at the trim lodge-gates of their hostess, and his
charge descended and fell in on the beautifully clipped
turf at the side of the drive, Tom felt some of the sensations
of Falstaff when he had to lead his ragged regiment
through Coventry streets.</p>

<p>He was soon at his ease again, and enjoyed the day
thoroughly, and the drive home; but, as they drew near
town again, a sense of discomfort and shyness came over
him, and he wished the journey to Westminster well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
over, and hoped that the carman would have the sense
to go through the quiet parts of the town.</p>

<p>He was much disconcerted, consequently, when the
vans came to a sudden stop, opposite one of the Park
entrances, in the Bayswater road. “What in the world
is Grey about?” he thought, as he saw him get out, and
all the children after him. So he got out himself, and
went forward to get an explanation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have told the man that he need not drive us
round to Westminster. He is close at home here, and
his horses have had a hard day; so we can just get out
and walk home.”</p>

<p>“What, across the Park?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will amuse the children, you know.”</p>

<p>“But they’re tired,” persisted Tom; “come now, it’s
all nonsense letting the fellow off; he’s bound to take
us back.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I have promised him,” said Grey; “besides,
the children all think it a treat. Don’t you all
want to walk across the Park?” he went on, turning to
them, and a general affirmative chorus was the answer.
So Tom had nothing for it but to shrug his shoulders,
empty his own van, and follow into the Park with his
convoy, not in the best humor with Grey for having arranged
this ending to their excursion.</p>

<p>They might have got over a third of the distance between
the Bayswater Road and the Serpentine, when he
was aware of a small thin voice addressing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, please won’t you carry me a bit? I’m so
tired,” said the voice. He turned in some trepidation
to look for the speaker, and found her to be a sickly undergrown
little girl, of ten or thereabouts, with large
pleading gray eyes, very shabbily dressed, and a little
lame. He had remarked her several times in the course
of the day, not for any beauty or grace about her, for
the poor child had none, but for her transparent confidence
and trustfulness. After dinner, as they had been
all sitting on the grass under the shade of a great elm to
hear Grey read a story, and Tom had been sitting a
little apart from the rest with his back against the
trunk, she had come up and sat quietly down by him,
leaning on his knee. Then he had seen her go up and
take the hand of the lady who had entertained them,
and walk along by her, talking without the least shyness.
Soon afterwards she had squeezed into the swing
by the side of the beautifully-dressed little daughter of
the same lady, who, after looking for a minute at her
shabby little sister with large round eyes, had jumped
out and run off to her mother, evidently in a state of
childish bewilderment as to whether it was not wicked
for a child to wear such dirty old clothes.</p>

<p>Tom had chuckled to himself as he saw Cinderella
settling herself comfortably in the swing in the place of
the ousted princess, and had taken a fancy to the child,
speculating to himself as to how she could have been
brought up, to be so utterly unconscious of differences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
rank and dress. “She seems really to treat her fellow-creatures
as if she had been studying the <i>Sartor Resartus</i>,”
he thought. “She has cut down through all
clothes-philosophy without knowing it. I wonder, if she
had a chance, whether she would go and sit down in the
Queen’s lap?”</p>

<p>He did not at that time anticipate that she would put
his own clothes-philosophy to so severe a test before the
day was over. The child had been as merry and active
as any of the rest during the earlier part of day; but
now, as he looked down in answer to her reiterated
plea, “Won’t you carry me a bit? I’m so tired!” he
saw that she could scarcely drag one foot after another.</p>

<p>What was to be done? He was already keenly alive
to the discomfort of walking across Hyde Park in a procession
of ragged children, with such a figure of fun as
Grey at their head, looking, in his long rusty, straight-cut
black coat, as if he had come fresh out of Noah’s ark.
He didn’t care about it so much while they were on the
turf in the out-of-the-way parts, and would meet nobody
but guards, and nurse-maids, and trades-people, and mechanics
out for an evening’s stroll. But the Drive and
Rotten-row lay before them, and must be crossed. It
was just the most crowded time of the day. He had
almost made up his mind once or twice to stop Grey
and the procession, and propose to sit down for half an
hour or so and let the children play, by which time the
world would be going home to dinner. But there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
no play left in the children; and he had resisted the
temptation, meaning, when they came to the most
crowded part, to look unconscious, as if it were by
chance that he got into such company, and had in fact
nothing to do with them. But now, if he listened to the
child’s plea, and carried her, all hope of concealment
was over. If he did not, he felt that there would be no
greater flunkey in the Park that evening than Thomas
Brown, the enlightened radical and philosopher, amongst
the young gentlemen riders in Rotten-row, or the powdered
footmen lounging behind the great glaring carriages
in the drive.</p>

<p>So he looked down at the child once or twice in a
state of puzzle. A third time she looked up with her
great eyes, and said, “Oh, please carry me a bit!” and
her piteous, tired face turned the scale. “If she were
Lady Mary or Lady Blanche,” thought he, “I should
pick her up at once, and be proud of the burden. Here
goes!” And he took her up in his arms, and walked
on, desperate and reckless.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all his philosophy, he felt his ears
tingling and his face getting red, as they approached
the Drive. It was crowded. They were kept standing
a minute or two at the crossing. He made a desperate
effort to abstract himself wholly from the visible world,
and retire into a state of serene contemplation. But it
would not do, and he was painfully conscious of the
stare of lack-lustre eyes of well-dressed men leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
over the rails, and the amused look of delicate ladies,
lounging in open carriages, and surveying him and Grey
and their ragged rout through glasses.</p>

<p>At last they scrambled across, and he breathed freely
for a minute, as they struggled along the comparatively
quiet path leading to Albert Gate, and stopped to drink
at the fountain. Then came Rotten-row, and another
pause amongst the loungers, and a plunge into the Ride,
where he was nearly run down by two men whom he had
known at Oxford. They shouted to him to get out of
the way; and he felt the hot defiant blood rushing
through his veins as he strode across without heeding.
They passed on, one of them having to pull his horse
out of his stride to avoid him. Did they recognize him?
He felt a strange mixture of utter indifference, and
longing to strangle them.</p>

<p>The worst was now over; besides, he was getting used
to the situation, and his good sense was beginning to
rally. So he marched through Albert Gate, carrying
his ragged little charge, who prattled away to him without
a pause, and surrounded by the rest of the children,
scarcely caring who might see him.</p>

<p>They went safely through the omnibuses and carriages
on the Kensington Road, and so into Belgravia. At
last he was quite at his ease again, and began listening
to what the child was saying to him, and was strolling
carelessly along, when once more, at one of the crossings,
he was startled by a shout from some riders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
There was straw laid down in the street, so that he
had not heard them as they cantered round the corner,
hurrying home to dress for dinner; and they were all
but upon him, and had to rein up their horses sharply.</p>

<p>The party consisted of a lady and two gentlemen, one
old, the other young; the latter dressed in the height of
fashion, and with the supercilious air which Tom hated
from his soul. The shout came from the young man,
and drew Tom’s attention to him first. All the devil
rushed up as he recognized St. Cloud. The lady’s horse
swerved against his, and began to rear. He put his
hand on its bridle, as if he had a right to protect her.
Another glance told Tom that the lady was Mary, and
the old gentleman, fussing up on his stout cob on the
other side of her, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p>They all knew him in another moment. He stared
from one to the other, was conscious that she turned her
horse’s head sharply, so as to disengage the bridle from
St. Cloud’s hand, and of his insolent stare, and of the
embarrassment of Mr. Porter; and then, setting his face
straight before him, he passed on in a bewildered dream,
never looking back till they were out of sight. The
dream gave way to bitter and wild thoughts, upon which
it will do none of us any good to dwell. He put down
the little girl outside the school, turning abruptly from
the mother, a poor widow in scant, well-preserved black
clothes, who was waiting for the child, and began thanking
him for his care of her; refused Grey’s pressing invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to tea, and set his face eastward. Bitterer and
more wild and more scornful grew his thoughts as he
strode along past the Abbey, and up Whitehall, and away
down the Strand, holding on over the crossings without
paying the slightest heed to vehicle, or horse, or man.
Incensed coachmen had to pull up with a jerk to avoid
running over him, and more than one sturdy walker
turned round in indignation at a collision which they
felt had been intended, or at least which there had been
no effort to avoid.</p>

<p>As he passed under the window of the Banqueting
Hall, and by the place in Charing-cross where the pillory
used to stand, he growled to himself what a pity it
was that the times for cutting off heads and cropping
ears had gone by. The whole of the dense population
from either side of the Strand seemed to have crowded
out into that thoroughfare to impede his march and
aggravate him. The further eastward he got the thicker
got the crowd; and the vans, the omnibuses, the cabs,
seemed to multiply and get noisier. Not an altogether
pleasant sight to a man in the most Christian frame of
mind is the crowd that a fine summer evening fetches
out into the roaring Strand, as the sun fetches out flies
on the window of a village grocery. To him just then
it was at once depressing and provoking, and he went
shouldering his way towards Temple Bar as thoroughly
out of tune as he had been for many a long day.</p>

<p>As he passed from the narrowest part of the Strand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
into the space round St. Clement Danes’ church, he was
startled, in a momentary lull of the uproar, by the sound
of chiming bells. He slackened his pace to listen; but
a huge van lumbered by, shaking the houses on both
sides, and drowning all sounds but its own rattle; and
then he found himself suddenly immersed in a crowd,
vociferating and gesticulating round a policeman, who
was conveying a woman towards the station-house. He
shouldered through it—another lull came, and with it
the same slow, gentle, calm cadence of chiming bells.
Again and again he caught it as he passed on to Temple
Bar; whenever the roar subsided the notes of the
old hymn-tune came dropping down on him like balm
from the air. If the ancient benefactor who caused the
bells of St. Clement Danes’ church to be arranged to
play that chime so many times a day is allowed to hover
round the steeple at such times, to watch the effect of
his benefaction on posterity, he must have been well
satisfied on that evening. Tom passed under the Bar,
and turned into the Temple another man, softened
again, and in his right mind.</p>

<p>“There’s always a voice saying the right thing to you
somewhere, if you’ll only listen for it,” he thought.</p>

<p>“It was because you were out of sorts with the world,
smarting with the wrongs you saw on every side, struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
after something better and higher, and siding and
sympathizing with the poor and weak, that I loved you.
We should never have been here, dear, if you had been
a young gentleman satisfied with himself and the world,
and likely to get on well in society.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mary, it’s all very well for a man. It’s a man’s
business. But why is a woman’s life to be made
wretched? Why should you be dragged into all my
perplexities, and doubts, and dreams, and struggles?”</p>

<p>“And why should I not?”</p>

<p>“Life should be all bright and beautiful to a woman.
It is every man’s duty to shield her from all that can vex,
or pain, or soil.”</p>

<p>“But have women different souls from men?”</p>

<p>“God forbid!”</p>

<p>“Then are we not fit to share your highest hopes?”</p>

<p>“To share our highest hopes! Yes, when we have
any. But the mire and clay where one sticks fast over
and over again, with no high hopes or high anything
else in sight—a man must be a selfish brute to bring
one he pretends to love into all that.”</p>

<p>“Now, Tom,” she said almost solemnly, “you are
not true to yourself. Would you, part with your own
deepest convictions? Would you if you could, go back
to the time when you cared for and thought about none
of these things?”</p>

<p>“He thought a minute, and then, pressing her hand,
said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, dearest, I would not. The consciousness of
the darkness in one and around one brings the longing
for light. And then the light dawns; through mist and
fog, perhaps, but enough to pick one’s way by.” He
stopped a moment, and then added, “and shines ever
brighter unto the-perfect day. Yes, I begin to know
it.”</p>

<p>“Then, why not put me on your own level? Why
not let me pick my way by your side? Cannot a woman
feel the wrongs that are going on in the world?
Cannot she long to see them set right, and pray that
they may be set right? We are not meant to sit in
fine silks, and look pretty, and spend money, any more
than you are meant to make it, and cry peace where
there is no peace. If a woman cannot do much herself,
she can honor and love a man who can.”</p>

<p>He turned to her, and bent over her, and kissed her
forehead, and kissed her lips. She looked up with
sparkling eyes and said:</p>

<p>“Am I not right, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right, and I have been false to my
creed. You have taken a load off my heart, dearest.
Henceforth there shall be but one mind and one soul
between us. You have made me feel what it is that a
man wants, what is the help that is meet for him.”</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes, and kissed her again; and
then rose up, for there was something within him like a
moving of new life, which lifted him, and set him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
his feet. And he stood with kindling brow, gazing into
the autumn air, as his heart went sorrowing, but hopefully
“sorrowing, back through all the faultful past.”
And she sat on at first, and watched his face; and
neither spoke nor moved for some minutes. Then she
rose too, and stood by his side:</p>

<p>There is no recorded end of a life that I know of more
entirely brave and manly than the one of Captain John
Brown, of which we know every minutest detail, as it
happened in the full glare of our modern life not twenty
years ago. About that I think there would scarcely be
disagreement anywhere. The very men who allowed
him to lie in his bloody clothes till the day of his execution,
and then hanged him, recognized this. “You
are a game man, Captain Brown,” the Southern sheriff
said in the wagon. “Yes,” he answered, “I was so
brought up. It was one of my mother’s lessons. From
infancy I have not suffered from physical fear. I have
suffered a thousand times more from bashfulness;” and
then he kissed a negro child in its mother’s arms, and
walked cheerfully on to the scaffold, thankful that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
was “allowed to die for a cause, and not merely to pay
the debt of nature, as all must.”</p>

<p>There is no simpler or nobler record in the “Book of
Martyrs,” and in passing I would only remind you, that
he at least was ready to acknowledge from whence came
his strength. “Christ, the great Captain of liberty as
well as of salvation,” he wrote just before his death,
“saw fit to take from me the sword of steel after I had
carried it for a time. But he has put another in my
hand, the sword of the Spirit, and I pray God to make
me a faithful soldier wherever he may send me.” And
to a friend who left him with the words, “If you can
be true to yourself to the end how glad we shall be,”
he answered, “I cannot say, but I do not think I shall
deny my Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>All chance of the speedy triumph of the kingdom of
God, humanly speaking, in the lake country of Galilee—the
battle-field chosen by himself, where his mightiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
works had been done and his mightiest words
spoken—the district from which his chosen companions
came, and in which clamorous crowds had been ready
to declare him king—is now over. The conviction
that this is so, that he is a baffled leader, in hourly
danger of his life, has forced itself on Christ. Before
entering that battle-field, face to face with the tempter
in the wilderness, he had deliberately rejected all aid
from the powers and kingdoms of this world, and now,
for the moment, the powers of this world have proved
too strong for him.</p>

<p>The rulers of that people—Pharisee, Sadducee, and
Herodian, scribe and lawyer—were now marshalled
against him in one compact phalanx, throughout all the
coasts of Galilee, as well as in Judea.</p>

<p>His disciples, rough, most of them peasants, full of patriotism,
but with small power of insight or self-control,
were melting away from a leader who, while he refused
them active service under a patriot chief at open war
with Cæsar and his legions, bewildered them by assuming
titles and talking to them in language which they
could not understand. They were longing for one who
would rally them against the Roman oppressor, and give
them a chance, at any rate, of winning their own land
again, purged of the heathen and free from tribute.
Such an one would be worth following to the death.
But what could they make of this “Son of Man,” who
would prove his title to that name by giving his body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and pouring out his blood for the life of man—of this
“Son of God,” who spoke of redeeming mankind and
exalting mankind to God’s right hand, instead of exalting
the Jew to the head of mankind?</p>

<p>In the face of such a state of things, to remain in
Capernaum, or the neighboring towns and villages,
would have been to court death, there, and at once.
The truly courageous man, you may remind me, is not
turned from his path by the fear of death, which is the
supreme test and touchstone of his courage. True;
nor was Christ so turned, even for a moment.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been his hopes in the earlier part
of his career, by this time he had no longer a thought
that mankind could be redeemed without his own perfect
and absolute sacrifice and humiliation. The cup
would indeed have to be drunk to the dregs, but not
here, nor now. This must be done at Jerusalem, the
centre of the national life and the seat of the Roman
government. It must be done during the Passover, the
national commemoration of sacrifice and deliverance.
And so he withdraws, with a handful of disciples, and even
they still wayward, half-hearted, doubting, from the constant
stress of a battle which has turned against him. From
this time he keeps away from the great centres of population,
except when, on two occasions—at the Feast of
Tabernacles and the Feast of the Dedication—he flashes
for a day on Jerusalem, and then disappears again into
some haunt of outlaws, or of wild beasts. This portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of his life comprises something less than the last twelve
months, from the summer of the second year of his
ministry till the eve of the last Passover, at Easter, in
the third year.</p>

<p>In glancing at the main facts of this period, as we have
done in the former ones, we have to note chiefly his
intercourse with the twelve apostles, and his preparation
of them for the end of his own career and the beginning
of theirs; his conduct at Jerusalem during those two
autumnal and winter feasts, and the occasions when he
again comes into collision with the rulers and Pharisees,
both at these feasts, and in the intervals between them.</p>

<p>The keynote of it, in spite of certain short and beautiful
interludes, appears to me to be a sense of loneliness
and oppression, caused by the feeling that he has work
to do, and words to speak, which those for whom they
are to be done and spoken, and whom they are, first of
all men, to bless, will either misunderstand or abhor.
Here is all the visible result of his labor and of his
travail, and the enemy is gathering strength every day.</p>

<p>This becomes clear, I think, at once, when, in the first
days after his quitting the lake shores, he asks his disciples
the question, “Whom do the world, and whom do
ye, say that I am?” He is answered by Peter in the well-known
burst of enthusiasm, that, though the people only
look on him as a prophet, such as Elijah or Jeremiah,
his own chosen followers see in him “the Christ, the
Son of the living God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>It is this particular moment which he selects for
telling them distinctly, that Christ will <i>not</i> triumph as
they regard triumphing; that he will fall into the power
of his enemies, and be humbled and slain by them. At
once the proof comes of how little even the best of his
own most intimate friends had caught the spirit of his
teaching or of his kingdom. The announcement of his
humiliation and death, which none but the most truthful
and courageous of men would have made at such a
moment, leaves them almost as much bewildered as the
crowds in the lake cities had been a few days before.</p>

<p>Their hearts are faithful and simple, and upon them,
as Peter has testified, the truth has flashed once for all,
and there can be no other Saviour of men than this man
with whom they are living. Still, by what means and to
what end the salvation shall come, they are scarcely less
ignorant than the people who had been in vain seeking
from him a sign such as they desired. His own elect
“understood not his saying, and it was hid from them,
that they perceived it not.” Rather, indeed, they go
straight from that teaching to dispute amongst themselves
who of them shall be the greatest in that kingdom
which they understand so little. And so their
Master has to begin again at the beginning of his
teaching, and, placing a little child amongst them, to
declare that not of such men as they deem themselves,
but of such as this child, is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>The episode of the Transfiguration follows; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
immediately after it, as though purposely to warn even
the three chosen friends who had been present against
new delusions, he repeats again the teaching as to his
death and humiliation. And he reiterates it whenever
any exhibition of power or wisdom seems likely to encourage
the frame of mind in the twelve generally which
had lately brought the great rebuke on Peter. How
slowly it did its work, even with the foremost disciples,
there are but too many proofs.</p>

<p>Amongst his kinsfolk and the people generally, his
mission, thanks to the cabals of the rulers and elders,
had come by this time to be looked upon with deep
distrust and impatience. “How long dost thou make
us to doubt? Go up to this coming feast, and there
prove your title before those who know how to judge in
such matters,” is the querulous cry of the former as the
Feast of Tabernacles approaches. He does not go up
publicly with the caravan, which would have been at
this time needlessly to incur danger, but, when the feast
is half over, suddenly appears in the temple. There he
again openly affronts the rulers by justifying his former
acts, and teaching and proclaiming that he who has sent
him is true, and is their God.</p>

<p>It is evidently on account of this new proof of daring
that the people now again begin to rally around him.
“Behold, he speaketh boldly. Do our rulers know that
this is Christ?” is the talk which fills the air, and induces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the scribes and Pharisees, for the first time, to attempt
his arrest by their officers.</p>

<p>The officers return without him, and their masters are,
for the moment, powerless before the simple word of
him who, as their own servants testify, “speaks as never
man spake.” But if they cannot arrest and execute,
they may entangle him further, and prepare for their
day, which is surely and swiftly coming. So they bring
to him the woman taken in adultery, and draw from him
the discourse in which he tells them that the truth will
make them free—the truth which he has come to tell
them, but which they will not hear, because they are of
their father the devil. He ends with asserting his claim
to the name which every Jew held sacred, “before
Abraham was, I am.” The narrative of the seventh
and eighth chapters of St. John, which record these
scenes at the Feast of Tabernacles, have, I believe,
done more to make men courageous and truly manly
than all the stirring accounts of bold deeds which ever
were written elsewhere.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXXXIX.</h2>


<p>All that was best and worst in the Jewish character
and history combined to render the Roman yoke intolerably
galling to the nation. The peculiar position
of Jerusalem—a sort of Mecca to the tribes acknowledging
the Mosaic law—made Syria the most dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of all the Roman provinces. To that city enormous
crowds of pilgrims of the most stiff-necked and fanatical
of all races flocked, three times at least in every year,
bringing with them offerings and tribute for the temple
and its guardians, on a scale which must have made the
hierarchy at Jerusalem formidable even to the world’s
master, by their mere command of wealth.</p>

<p>But this would be the least of the causes of anxiety
to the Roman governor, as he spent year after year face
to face with these terrible leaders of a terrible people.</p>

<p>These high priests and rulers of the Jews were indeed
quite another kind of adversaries from the leaders,
secular or religious, of any of those conquered countries
which the Romans were wont to treat with contemptuous
toleration. They still represented living traditions
of the glory and sanctity of their nation, and of Jerusalem,
and exercised still a power over that nation which
the most resolute and ruthless of Roman procurators
did not care wantonly to brave.</p>

<p>At the same time the yoke of high priest and scribe
and Pharisee was even heavier on the necks of their own
people than that of the Roman. They had built up a
huge superstructure of traditions and ceremonies round
the law of Moses, which they held up to the people as
more sacred and binding than the law itself. This superstructure
was their special charge. This was, according
to them, the great national inheritance, the most
valuable portion of the covenant which God had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
with their fathers. To them, as leaders of their nation—a
select, priestly, and learned caste—this precious
inheritance had been committed. Outside that caste,
the dim multitude, “the people which knoweth not the
law,” were despised while they obeyed, accursed as soon
as they showed any sign of disobedience. Such being
the state of Judea, it would not be easy to name in all
history a less hopeful place for the reforming mission of
a young carpenter, a stranger from a despised province,
one entirely outside the ruling caste, though of the royal
race, and who had no position whatever in any rabbinical
school.</p>

<p>In Galilee the surroundings were slightly different,
but scarcely more promising. Herod Antipas, the
weakest of that tyrant family, the seducer of his brother’s
wife, the fawner on Cæsar, the spendthrift oppressor of
the people of his tetrarchy, still ruled in name over the
country, but with Roman garrisons in the cities and
strongholds. Face to face with him, and exercising an
<i>imperium in imperio</i> throughout Galilee were the same
priestly caste, though far less formidable to the civil
power and to the people, than in the southern province.
Along the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, the chief
scene of our Lord’s northern ministry, lay a net-work of
towns densely inhabited, and containing a large admixture
of Gentile traders. This infusion of foreign blood,
the want of any such religious centre as Jerusalem, and
the contempt with which the southern Jews regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
their provincial brethren of Galilee, had no doubt
loosened to some extent the yoke of the priests and
scribes and lawyers in that province. But even here
their traditionary power over the masses of the people
was very great, and the consequences of defying their
authority as penal, though the penalty might be neither
so swift or so certain, as in Jerusalem itself. Such was
the society into which Christ came.</p>

<p>It is not easy to find a parallel case in the modern
world, but perhaps the nearest exists in a portion of
our own empire. The condition of parts of India in
our day resembles in some respects that of Palestine in
the year <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 30. In the Mahratta country, princes,
not of the native dynasty, but the descendants of foreign
courtiers (like the Idumean Herods), are reigning. British
residents at their courts, hated and feared, but
practically all-powerful as Roman procurators, answer
to the officers and garrisons of Rome in Palestine. The
people are in bondage to a priestly caste scarcely less
heavy than that which weighed on the Judean and Galilean
peasantry. If the Mahrattas were Mohammedans,
and Mecca were situate in the territory of Scindia or
Holkar; if the influence of twelve centuries of Christian
training could be wiped out of the English character,
and the stubborn and fierce nature of the Jew substituted
for that of the Mahratta; a village reformer
amongst them, whose preaching outraged the Brahmins,
threatened the dynasties, and disturbed the English residents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
would start under somewhat similar conditions to
those which surrounded Christ when he commenced his
ministry.</p>

<p>In one respect, and one only, the time seemed
propitious. The mind and heart of the nation was full
of the expectation of a coming Messiah—a King who
should break every yoke from off the necks of his
people, and should rule over the nations, sitting on the
throne of David. The intensity of this expectation had,
in the opening days of his ministry, drawn crowds into
the wilderness beyond Jordan from all parts of Judea
and Galilee, at the summons of a preacher who had
caught up the last cadence of the song of their last
great prophet, and was proclaiming that both the deliverance
and the kingdom which they were looking for were
at hand. In those crowds who flocked to hear John the
Baptist there were doubtless some even amongst the
priests and scribes, and many amongst the poor Jewish
and Galilean peasantry, who felt that there was a
heavier yoke upon them than that of Rome or of
Herod Antipas. But the record of the next three years
shows too clearly that even these were wholly unprepared
for any other than a kingdom of this world, and
a temporal throne to be set up in the holy city.</p>

<p>And so, from the first, Christ had to contend not only
against the whole of the established powers of Palestine,
but against the highest aspirations of the best of
his countrymen. These very Messianic hopes, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
proved the greatest stumbling-block in his path. Those
who entertained them most vividly had the greatest
difficulty in accepting the carpenter’s son as the promised
Deliverer. A few days only before the end he had
sorrowfully to warn the most intimate and loving of his
companions and disciples, “Ye know not what spirit ye
are of.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXL.</h2>


<p>The Jews were always thinking of their exclusive
religious privileges, of the sacredness of the Temple
and of the law, and of the questionable and dangerous
position of those who were outside the covenant. Now
this habit of mind, undoubtedly religious as it was, is
not held up to our admiration in the New Testament,
but the contrary. It is denounced as being the opposite
of a true spirituality. It is shown to us as associated
with intolerance, bigotry, hardness, cruelty, as most
offensive to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
fruitful of mischief in the world. St. Paul had to
undergo the reproach of being disloyal to the religion
of his fathers, because he contended against this ecclesiastical
spirit. But the reproach was as unjust as it
was painful to him. He loved the holy city and the
temple and the ordinances of the law and his kindred
according to the flesh; but he knew that the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
aim of a devout man was not to hedge round an
organization, but to glorify and bear witness to the
Divine Spirit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXLI.</h2>


<p>Not St. Paul only, but all the Apostles and Evangelists,
were continually contemplating the heavenly glory
of a brotherhood of men in full harmony with each other
because all joined to Christ, of men walking in humility
and meekness and love, endeavoring to keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is nothing in
such an ideal less suited to us to-day than to the Christians
of the first age. For ourselves, and for our neighbors
and fellow-men, this hope should be in our hearts,
this Divine ideal before our eyes. Let us believe that
it is the Divine purpose, and that we are called to the
fulfilment of it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXLII.</h2>


<p>Is it not an express principle in the teaching of our
Lord himself and of his Apostles, that means and instruments
and agencies are not to be worshipped in
themselves but to be estimated with reference to the end
they are to promote? Think, for example, what is implied
in that pregnant sentence, “The Sabbath was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” Means
and instruments are not dishonored by this principle.
If the end they serve is high and precious, they also will
deserve to be valued. If the spiritual freedom of man
is important, then the ordinance of a Day of Rest,
which ministers to it, may well be sacred. But it is often
appointed in the Providence of God that an apparent
dishonor should be cast on means, that the minds of
men may be forced away from resting upon them. And
means may be varied, according to circumstances,
whilst the same permanent end is to be sought.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CXLIII.</h2>


<p>Wherever there is good, in whatever Samaritan or
heathen we may see kindness and the fear of God,
there we are to welcome it and rejoice in it in our
Father’s name.</p>

<p>There is no respect of persons with God, no acceptance
of any man on account of his religion or his profession;
under whatever religious garb, he that loveth
is born of God, he that doeth righteousness is born of
God. There is no danger in being ready to appreciate
simple goodness and to refer it to the working of the
Divine Spirit wherever we may find it; there is the
greatest danger in failing to appreciate it. This is
doctrine of unquestionable Divine authority, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
may often have opportunities of putting into practice.
Let us remember to cherish it in all our dealings with
those who do not belong to our own church. Let us be
afraid lest nature and the flesh should make us intolerant
and unsympathetic; let us be sure that Christ and
the Spirit would win us to modesty and reverence and
sympathy.</p>

<p>“There is one body and one spirit, even as ye were
called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith,
one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above
all and through all and in all.” With this unity, there
are distinctions of function; and each member, St. Paul
holds, has his own gift of endowment to enable him to
fill his own place. Christ is the great Giver, and besides
these gifts to the several members of the body, he
gave to the body as a whole the apostles, prophets,
evangelists, pastors, and teachers, by whose various
ministries sinful and self-willed men were to be moulded
into true members, and ultimate perfecting of the body
to be accomplished. St. Paul looked forward in hope
to the time when the Body of Christ might be not only
ideally perfect, but actually perfect also, in its adult
growth and in the harmonious co-operation of all its
parts.</p>

<p>There may be every sort of defect and irregularity in
the men and women whom Christ has called to be his

not depend upon them. Their business is to <i>keep</i> the

<p>As I understand the word “politician,” it means a
man who, whatever his other engagements in life may
be, and however he may earn his daily bread, feels
above all things deeply interested, feels that he is bound
to be deeply interested, and to take as active a part as
he can, in the public affairs of his country. I believe
that every Englishman, if he is worth anything at all,
is bound to be a politician, and can’t for the life of him
help taking a deep interest in the public affairs of his
country. The object of politics is the well-being of the
nation, or in other words to make “a wise and understanding
people.” Now, what are the means by which
a wise and an understanding people is to be made?
Well, of course, the chief means of making a wise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
understanding people is by training them up in wisdom
and understanding. The State wants men who are
brave, truthful, generous; the State wants women who
are pure, simple, gentle. By what means is the State to
get citizens of that kind?</p>

<p>Such a politician looking around him and seeing how
the national conscience is to be touched—for unless
the national conscience be touched you can never raise
citizens of that kind—finds that the great power which
alone can do it, is that which goes by the name of
religion.</p>

<p>The true work of the Liberal Party in a Liberal age
is, with singleness of purpose and all its might, to lift
the people to a fair and full share of all the best things
of this life,—its highest culture, hopes, aspirations,
burdens—as well as its loaves and fishes—and, setting
before them a truly noble ideal of citizenship, to help
them to attain it. Whatever goes beyond that, or
beside that, savors of Jacobinism, for then comes in
that jealousy which is the bane of true democracy.
The true democrat has no old scores to pay, covets no
man’s good things, wants nothing for himself which is
not open to his neighbors, will destroy nothing which
others value merely because he doesn’t value it himself,
unless it is palpably and incurably unjust and unrighteous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>

<p>A liberal politician is a man who looks to the future
and not to the past; he looks for progress; he desires
to see the whole nation raised; he desires to go on from
better things to better things, and he is not afraid of
new things; he holds that every institution must be
tried by its worth and its value to the nation;—he holds
above all things that there should be equality before the
law for every institution, for every society, and for
every individual citizen.</p>

<p>Alfred the Great had his problems of anarchy, widespread
lawlessness, terrorism, to meet. After the best
thought he could give to the business, he met them and
prevailed. Like diseases call for like cures; and we
may assume without fear that a remedy which has been
very successful in one age is at least worth looking at
in another.</p>

<p>We too, like Alfred, have our own troubles—our
land-questions, labor-questions, steady increase of pauperism,
and others. In our struggle for life we fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
with different weapons, and have our advantages of one
kind or another over our ancestors; but when all is said
and done there is scarcely more coherence in the English
nation of to-day than in that of 1079. Individualism,
no doubt, has its noble side; and “every man for
himself” is a law which works wonders; but we cannot
shut our eyes to the fact that under their action English
life has become more and more disjointed, threatening
in some directions altogether to fall to pieces. What we
specially want is something which shall bind us more
closely together. Every nation of Christendom is feeling
after the same thing. The need of getting done in
some form that which frank-pledge did for Alfred’s people
expresses itself in Germany in mutual-credit banks,
open to every honest citizen; in France, in the productive
associations of all kinds; at home, in our co-operative
movements and trades-union.</p>

<p>No mere machinery, nothing that governments or legislatures
can do in our day, will be of much help, but they
may be great hindrances. The study of the modern statesman
must be how to give such movements full scope
and a fair chance, so that the people may be able without
let or hindrance to work out in their own way the
principle which Alfred brought practically home to his
England, that in human society men cannot divest themselves
of responsibility for their neighbors, and ought
not to be allowed to attempt it.</p>

<p>The more attentively we study Alfred’s life, the more
clearly does the practical wisdom of his methods of government
justify itself by results. Of strong princes, with
minds “rectified and prepared” on the Machiavellian
model, the world has had more than enough, who have
won kingdoms for themselves, and used them for themselves,
and so left a bitter inheritance to their children
and their people. It is well that, here and there in history,
we can point to a king whose reign has proved
that the highest success in government is not only compatible
with, but dependent upon, the highest Christian
morality.</p>

the fulfilment of his obligations, as he would from a lie.
I would sooner see a son of mine in his grave than
crawling on through life a slave to wants and habits
which he must gratify at other people’s expense.</p>

<h2>CLIII.</h2>


<p>No two men take a thing just alike, and very few
can sit down quietly when they have lost a fall in
life’s wrestle, and say, “Well, here I am, beaten no
doubt this time. By my own fault too. Now, take a
good look at me, my good friends, as I know you all
want to do, and say your say out, for I mean getting up
again directly and having another turn at it.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CLIV.</h2>


<p>No man who is worth his salt can leave a place where
he has gone through hard and searching discipline, and
been tried in the very depths of his heart, without regret,
however much he may have winced under the discipline.
It is no light thing to fold up and lay by for
ever a portion of one’s life, even when it can be laid by
with honor and in thankfulness.</p>

<div class="adtitle2">FROM DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>By <i>Pansy</i> and <i>Faye Huntington</i>. 12mo. Price $1.50,
Boston: D. Lothrop &amp; Co.,<br /><br /></p>


<p>If there is any better writer of Sunday School books than
“Pansy,” we should like to make her acquaintance, she
has a rare tact in story telling, and knows quite as well what
to omit as what to say. Even the sternest critics, of S. S.
Literature surrender to Pansy, in spite of themselves, and
confess that her books are worth reading.</p>

<p>“From Different Standpoints” is not quite so broad in its
range as some of her previous works, but is more intense.
The story is so full of life, though made up largely of letters
and journals, the characters are so sharply drawn with so
thorough an insight into the possibilities of human nature,
and the religious element is of so high a type, and yet withal
so natural, that the most careless reader is fascinated, and
feels the inspiration of a noble Christian life. Such books,
are a valuable addition to any S. S. libraries, and will supplement
the best religious teachings of Bible-class or pulpit.</p>

<p>As to the double authorship of the book, Faye Huntington
is so nearly the double of Pansy, that her separate work
cannot be detected.</p></div>

By <i>Pansy</i>. 12mo. Illustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     1 50<br />

<p>“Pansy knows girls, and has the gift of story-telling, by which
the hard facts of every-day life take on a charm as of fairy-land. No
one can look into ‘The Chautauqua Girls’ without feeling the
subtle fascination of its pictures of quiet life, and being drawn into
warm sympathy with the four friends who long to form noble characters.
They have been won to a love of Jesus by attending a
camp-meeting at Chautauqua; but they find it so hard to be true
to their new impulses, and to carry the spirit of the Bible into
every-day life, that the story of their struggles, disheartening failures
relieved by partial successes, is very human and full of genuine
pathos. It is good summer reading, for beguiling away hours, and
inspiring with generous purposes.”</p>

<p>“Pansy’s last book, ‘The Chautauqua Girls at Home,’ is as
fresh and inspiring as a fine morning in June. The four friends,
Marion, Ruth, Flossy and Eurie, are of genuine flesh and blood,
with the petty weaknesses that flesh is heir to, and the noble aspirations
that come at times to every high-minded girl. Their unlikeness
to each other in character and social position, and their mutual
helpfulness in all sorts of difficulties, make a delightful story; instructive
as well as fascinating. One finds it hard to lay down the
book after beginning the first chapter. It will find many readers
who will welcome its stimulating power to high aims in life, and to
patience and hope in fighting hard battles.”</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
